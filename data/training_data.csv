10696,how news media promote covid-19?,Pandemic Populism: Facebook Pages of Alternative News Media and the Corona Crisis - A Computational Content Analysis,"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had severe political, economic, and societal effects, it has also affected media and communication systems in unprecedented ways. While traditional journalistic media has tried to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous ""fake news"" or conspiracy theories via social media and other online channels. The current study analyzes the factual basis of such fears in an initial computational content analysis of alternative news media's output on Facebook during the early Corona crisis, based on a large German data set from January to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis, methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined, as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in this analysis.","Alternative news media on Facebook contribute to a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview during the COVID-19 pandemic by sharing overly critical, anti-systemic messages.",question,1451,182.0
1086,what is the relationship between self-efficacy and resistance training performance in athletes,Self-efficacy does not appear to mediate training’s effect on performance based on the moderation-of-process design,"ABSTRACT Researchers in the area of training and motivation have concluded that training causes improvements in performance partially via training’s influence on self-efficacy. A set of studies employing a moderation-of-process design contradicts this conclusion. Specifically, when two groups of trainees did not know their performance was increasing during training, their self-efficacy did not increase. Two other groups were able to observe improving performance, which enhanced self-efficacy. However, both groups in both studies exhibited equal improvement in performance. This effect was shown in two contexts: training on a physical task and training on a cognitive task. These results demonstrate that self-efficacy might not always play a causal role in determining training’s influence. The studies highlight the value of a rarely used moderation-of-process method for assessing mediation.",Self-efficacy might not always play a causal role in determining training's influence on performance in athletes.,question,900,113.0
9111,are there any evidences that using nanomaterial could help freezing human platelets?,Use of Nanomaterials in Cryobiology and Cryomedicine,"The review considers the possibility of using modern nanotechnological developments aimed to achieve alternative cryobiological goals. On the one hand, the use of nanomaterials will increase the functional value of thawed cells due to such unique characteristics of nanoparticles as size, shape, surface charge, chemical composition, etc. Nanomaterials can be used as nanocontainers for impermeable cryoprotective agents (CPAs) and cause significant changes in crystal formation, thermal conductivity and other properties of cells, tissues and organs, that increases the efficiency of their cryopreservation. On the other hand, the combined use of nanomaterials and low-temperature freezing factors is considered a promising method of destruction of pathologically altered cells and tissues, as it minimizes the risk of recurrence of oncopathology after insufficient freezing-out of the tumor site.",Nanomaterials could be used to achieve cryobiology goals as it can increase the efficency of cryopreservation.,question,898,110.0
20300,Does universal pre-K make for worse outcomes?,Will Public Pre-K Really Close Achievement Gaps? Gaps in Prekindergarten Quality Between Students and Across States,"Publicly funded pre-K is often touted as a means to narrow achievement gaps, but this goal is less likely to be achieved if poor and/or minority children do not, at a minimum, attend equal quality pre-K as their non-poor, non-minority peers. In this paper, I find large “quality gaps” in public pre-K between poor, minority students and non-poor, non-minority students, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 SD on a range of classroom observational measures. I also find that even after adjusting for several classroom characteristics, significant and sizable quality gaps remain. Finally, I find much between-state variation in gap magnitudes and that state-level quality gaps are related to state-level residential segregation. These findings are particularly troubling if a goal of public pre-K is to minimize inequality.","Universal pre-K may not effectively narrow achievement gaps due to large ""quality gaps"" between poor, minority students and non-poor, non-minority students.",question,810,156.0

6309,how news media promote covid-19?,Datasets and Approaches of COVID-19 Misinformation Detection: A Survey,"Social media has become a primary source of news, providing a fertile environment for spreading misinformation. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, misleading information related to COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly and widely on social media. Several conspiracy theories have emerged regarding the origin of the COVID-19, potential treatments, and vaccines posing a real threat to the public health of people. Fake news that promotes vaccine hesitancy might jeopardize achieving the levels of vaccination needed to reach herd immunity and end the pandemic. The need for automatic tools that detect COVID-19 related misinformation has encouraged researchers to propose several Machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Many datasets have been released since the start of the pandemic, aiming to assess the performance of misinformation detection methods. This survey reviews the datasets that have been released to analyze the related to COVID-19 in general and COVID-19 misinformation detection in particular released in Arabic, English, and other languages. We also provide an overview of the different methods used to detect COVID-19 fake news.

4061,does microbiome affect leukemia,Role of the microbiome in non-gastrointestinal cancers.,"""The forgotten organ"", the human microbiome, comprises a community of microorganisms that colonizes various sites of the human body. Through coevolution of bacteria, archaea and fungi with the human host over thousands of years, a complex host-microbiome relationship emerged in which many functions, including metabolism and immune responses, became codependent. This coupling becomes evident when disruption in the microbiome composition, termed dysbiosis, is mirrored by the development of pathologies in the host. Among the most serious consequences of dysbiosis, is the development of cancer. As many as 20% of total cancers worldwide are caused by a microbial agent. To date, a vast majority of microbiome-cancer studies focus solely on the microbiome of the large intestine and the development of gastrointestinal cancers. Here, we will review the available evidence implicating microbiome involvement in the development and progression of non-gastrointestinal cancers, while distinguishing between viral and bacterial drivers of cancer, as well as ""local"" and ""systemic"", ""cancer-stimulating"" and ""cancer-suppressing"" effects of the microbiome.

19938,what are the benefits of intermittent fasting?,Intermittent Fasting: Potential Utility in the Treatment of Chronic Pain across the Clinical Spectrum,"Dietary behavior can have a consequential and wide-ranging influence on human health. Intermittent fasting, which involves intermittent restriction in energy intake, has been shown to have beneficial cellular, physiological, and system-wide effects in animal and human studies. Despite the potential utility in preventing, slowing, and reversing disease processes, the clinical application of intermittent fasting remains limited. The health benefits associated with the simple implementation of a 12 to 16 h fast suggest a promising role in the treatment of chronic pain. A literature review was completed to characterize the physiologic benefits of intermittent fasting and to relate the evidence to the mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Research on different fasting regimens is outlined and an overview of research demonstrating the benefits of intermittent fasting across diverse health conditions is provided. Data on the physiologic effects of intermittent fasting are summarized. The physiology of different pain states is reviewed and the possible implications for intermittent fasting in the treatment of chronic pain through non-invasive management, prehabilitation, and rehabilitation following injury and invasive procedures are presented. Evidence indicates the potential utility of intermittent fasting in the comprehensive management of chronic pain and warrants further investigation.","Intermittent fasting shows potential in treating chronic pain through non-invasive management, prehabilitation, and rehabilitation.",question,1403,131.0
18622,is jet lag a real thing?,Critical phase shifts slow down circadian clock recovery: implications for jet lag.,"Advancing or delaying the light-dark (LD) cycle perturbs the circadian clock, which eventually recovers its original phase with respect to the new LD cycle. Readjustment of the clock occurs by shifting its phase in the same (orthodromic re-entrainment) or opposite direction (antidromic re-entrainment) as the shift in the LD cycle. To investigate circadian clock recovery after phase shifts of the LD cycle we use a detailed computational model previously proposed for the cellular regulatory network underlying the mammalian circadian clock. The model predicts the existence of a sharp threshold separating orthodromic from antidromic re-entrainment. In the vicinity of this threshold, resynchronization of the clock after a phase shift markedly slows down. The type of re-entrainment, the position of the threshold and the time required for resynchronization depend on multiple factors such as the autonomous period of the clock, the direction and magnitude of the phase shift, the clock biochemical kinetic parameters, and light intensity. Partitioning the phase shift into a series of smaller phases shifts decreases the impact on the recovery of the circadian clock. We use the phase response curve to predict the location of the threshold separating orthodromic and antidromic re-entrainment after advanced or delayed phase shifts of the LD cycle. The marked increase in recovery times predicted near the threshold could be responsible for the most severe disturbances of the human circadian clock associated with jet lag.","Jet lag is real, as the marked increase in recovery times after phase shifts of the light-dark cycle can cause severe disturbances in the human circadian clock.",question,1529,160.0

9011,what are the current nanomedicine-based drugs advancements?,Nanocatalytic Medicine,"Catalysis and medicine are often considered as two independent research fields with their own respective scientific phenomena. Promoted by recent advances in nanochemistry, large numbers of nanocatalysts, such as nanozymes, photocatalysts, and electrocatalysts, have been applied in vivo to initiate catalytic reactions and modulate biological microenvironments for generating therapeutic effects. The rapid growth of research in biomedical applications of nanocatalysts has led to the concept of “nanocatalytic medicine,” which is expected to promote the further advance of such a subdiscipline in nanomedicine. The high efficiency and selectivity of catalysis that chemists strived to achieve in the past century can be ingeniously translated into high efficacy and mitigated side effects in theranostics by using “nanocatalytic medicine” to steer catalytic reactions for optimized therapeutic outcomes. Here, the rationale behind the construction of nanocatalytic medicine is eludicated based on the essential reaction factors of catalytic reactions (catalysts, energy input, and reactant). Recent advances in this burgeoning field are then comprehensively presented and the mechanisms by which catalytic nanosystems are conferred with theranostic functions are discussed in detail. It is believed that such an emerging catalytic therapeutic modality will play a more important role in the field of nanomedicine.","Nanocatalytic medicine applies nanocatalysts like nanozymes, photocatalysts, and electrocatalysts in vivo for therapeutic effects, high efficacy, and mitigated side effects in theranostics.",question,1415,189.0

17704,"do dairy products, particulalry milk, increase pcos",A survey of PCB congeners in U.K. cows' milk.,"Samples of unpasteurised bulked milk, taken directly from ten herds of dairy cattle on rural and urban farms in the north west of England on five separate sampling occasions, were analysed for a range of PCB congeners. Sigma PCB concentrations (sum of 37 congeners) ranged from 3.4-16.4 ng/g milk fat with a mean sigma PCB concentration of 8.4 ng/g milk fat. The dominating congeners were 118, 153, 138 and 180, which contributed 15%, 20%, 17% and 9% of the sigma PCB load respectively. The chlorine pattern of the congeners which made moderate or major contributions to the sigma PCB concentration were typically substituted at both para positions (4,4'), while the PCB congeners not detected in the milk had at least one ring that was not 4-substituted. These results indicate the 4,4' substitution pattern as being the key to PCB persistence in cows. It is estimated that consumption of typical daily intakes of milk with the PCB concentrations measured in this study would contribute 11% of the average daily sigma PCB intake for individuals in the UK. This contribution would increase to 30% when exposure through the consumption of dairy products prepared from such milk (e.g. cheese, butter) is taken into account. It is estimated that the inclusion of the TEF assigned PCBs would typically increase the TEQ rating of cows' milk by approximately 40% over that attributed to PCDD/Fs alone.","The 4,4' substitution pattern is key to PCB persistence in cows, contributing to 11% of the average daily sigma PCB intake for individuals in the UK.",question,1395,149.0
818,what are the recent influential researches on game narrative?,Videogames as “Minor Literature”: Reading Videogame Stories through Paratexts,"Videogames have, since the beginning of game studies as a discipline, been placed at a problematic cusp between games and narratives. Stories are important in videogames, especially in those such as Grand Theft Auto IV (2008), Fallout 3 (2008), and other games with a pronounced narrative intention. However, the element of play and multiplicity of the narrative makes it difficult to analyze them with traditional critical tools: it is easy, therefore, to dismiss them from the narrative canon. Another problem that videogame research faces is that game-narratives are ephemeral and the textual artefact of the game is substantially contained in the player’s experience. However, an entire range of paratexts, such as walkthroughs and after-action reports, where players construct narratives while recording their in-game experiences, are available for analysis. This paper points towards the urgency of beginning to study ludic paratexts like walkthroughs and after-action reports to understand better the narrative process in videogames. In doing so, it will explore how a player has rewritten the history of Rome through Rome: Total War (2004) and how to do science fiction differently in Fallout 3. Simultaneously, it will identify similar characteristics in examples from established literary media, such as Julio Cortazar’s Hopscotch (1987) and Italo Calvino’s A Castle of Crossed Destinies (1977), to name only a couple.",Studying ludic paratexts like walkthroughs and after-action reports can help better understand the narrative process in videogames.,question,1428,131.0
3342,does high protein diet protect against bone loss as we age?,Protein and bone health across the lifespan,"Bone health is determined by the rate of accrual in early life, followed by the rate of age-associated bone loss. Dietary protein intake might have a role in bone health across both of these phases via pleiotropic mechanistic pathways. Herein we summarise the pathways through which protein may exert either a positive or negative influence on bone. In the introduction, we describe the acid-ash hypothesis, which states that a high-protein intake may lead to an acidic residue that must be neutralised through the leaching of calcium and other minerals from the bone, subsequently leading to demineralisation and bone weakening. Conversely, and as described in the ‘Against: mechanisms through which protein may negatively impact bone’ section, protein intake may act to strengthen the bone by stimulating the activity of various anabolic hormones and growth factors, or by optimising muscle mass and functionality, which itself has an osteogenic influence. The net effect of these contrasting pathways is described in the ‘For: mechanisms through which protein may positively impact bone’ section, where a number of meta-analyses have demonstrated that higher protein intakes have a small positive impact on bone mass and fracture risk. Sometimes higher than recommended protein intakes are advised, e.g. during the earlier and later phases of the lifespan or during reduced energy availability. We conclude that protein is an essential nutrient for bone health, although further research is required to clarify the mechanistic pathways through which it exerts its influence, along with the clarification of the quantities, food sources and timing to allow for the optimisation of this protective influence and ultimately a reduction in fracture risk.",Higher protein intakes have a small positive impact on bone mass and fracture risk.,question,1753,83.0
15715,Do interest rates impact inflation?,Stock market performance: Reaction to interest rates and inflation rates,"This paper investigates the wealth effects of the consumer price index, interest rate, domestic credit and real economic activity on the Amman Stock Exchange performance. Over the period 1991–2020 using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test. While the interest rate is a powerful monetary tool to fight inflation and recession, it can be detrimental to investors. The target variables, consumer price index (CPI) and interest rate (IDR), are both highly significant with the correct signs. An increase of 1 percent in CPI and IDR leads to a fall in stock prices by 1.6 percent and 5 percent, respectively. While the central bank is targeting inflation by raising interest rates, its actions reflect negatively on the stock market. The short-run model confirms the causality from the independent variables to the dependent variable. Moreover, the error correction term (ECT) is very high and significant at the 1 percent level amounting to 83.3 percent, which confirms the evidence of the long-run relationship.

We identified 205 episodes of systemic pneumococcal infections in 201 children during a 34 mo. period. There were 54 infections in 1978 (10 months), 64 in 1979 and 87 in 1980. The frequency of infections was highest in May and April (mean number of episodes/month 10.3 and 9.3 respectively) and was lowest in August and September (1.3 and 1.6). Children with pneumococcal infection ranged in age from 1 month to 14 years (mean age of 20 months). There were 126 boys and 75 girls. Seventy six percent of the children were black. Occult bacteremia (128 episodes) was the most frequently seen illness. There were 40 instances of pneumonia with bacteremia, 31 of meningitis, 4 of cellulitis and 2 of septic arthritis. Three children had recurrent infections: one with sickle cell anemia had three separate episodes caused by type 23F despite having received pneumococcal vaccine. Four children died: two had meningitis, one (asplenic child) had bacteremia and one (with myocarditis) had bacteremic pneumonia. One hundred thirty isolates were serotyped.

The multifactorial TMD etiology is related to emotional tension, occlusal interferences, tooth loss, postural deviation, masticatory muscular dysfunction, internal and external changes in TMJ structure and the various associations of these factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the relationship between signs of psychological distress and temporomandibular disorder in university students. A total 150 volunteers participated in this study. They attended different courses in the field of human science at one public university and four private universities. TMD was assessed by the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) questionnaire. Anxiety was measured by means of a self-evaluative questionnaire, Spielberger's Trait-State anxiety inventory, to evaluate students'state and trait anxiety. The results of the two questionnaires were compared to determine the relationship between anxiety levels and severity degrees of chronic TMD pain by means of the chi-square test. The significance level was set at 5%. The statistical analysis showed that the TMD degree has a positive association with state-anxiety (p = 0.008; p < 0.05) and negative with trait-anxiety (p = 0.619; p < 0.05).

The fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, IR, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), Malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), sex hormones and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Result At the end of the study, the mean of FBS, insulin, IR, TC, TG, LDL, MDA, CRP, TNF-α, total testosterone, prolactin and AMH were significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the placebo group ( P  < 0.05). Also, there was a significant increase in the mean of TAC after supplementation with EA ( P  < 0.05). At the end of the study, no significant changes were observed in the mean of anthropometric factors, physical activity and food intake ( P  > 0.05). Conclusion EA supplementation can be helpful as a diet supplement in women with PCOS through improvement in insulin resistance. This supplement may be used to reduce metabolic disorders in women.

7546,what are the short-term and long-term effects of unethical pro-organisational behavior?,Feeling proud but guilty? Unpacking the paradoxical nature of unethical pro-organizational behavior,"Abstract Integrating appraisal theories of emotion and the literature of self-conscious emotion, we argue that UPB has a paradoxical nature that can lead to ambivalent emotional reactions, with implications for subsequent behavior. On the one hand, because UPB benefits one’s organization, it should trigger feelings of pride. However, given its unethical nature, UPB should also trigger feelings of guilt. Using an experience sampling study of 91 customer-service agent dyads in the technology consultancy industry, we find that daily UPB is positively associated with daily pride and guilt. These emotions in turn lead to increased citizenship behavior directed towards the organization and customers, respectively. We replicate these findings with another experience sampling study of 78 triads (focal employees, co-workers, and customers) in the financial service industry. More importantly, we find that service employees’ guilt proneness moderates the link between daily UPB and pride, such that UPB leads to heightened feelings of pride especially when the service employees have lower levels of guilt proneness. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our work.","Unethical pro-organizational behavior can lead to feelings of both pride and guilt, which in turn increase citizenship behavior towards the organization and customers.",question,1201,167.0

7797,are weighted blankets good for anxiety?,Weighted Blanket Use: A Systematic Review.,"IMPORTANCE
Sensory integration modalities, such as weighted blankets, are used in occupational therapy practice to assist with emotional and physical regulation. However, the research related to the use and effectiveness of weighted blankets is sparse.


OBJECTIVE
To identify, evaluate, and synthesize the current literature to help develop the impetus needed to launch a research study into the effectiveness of using weighted blankets to decrease anxiety and insomnia.


DATA SOURCES
A literature search was conducted between January 23, 2018, and March 1, 2018. Databases and sites included the Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, OTseeker, Web of Science, and Nursing Reference Center Plus. Search terms included weighted blanket, deep pressure, and occupational therapy as well as combinations of these terms.


STUDY SELECTION AND DATA COLLECTION
This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles were included if the study used weighted blankets as the modality of deep pressure stimulation. Data from presentations, conference proceedings, non-peer-reviewed literature, dissertations, and theses were excluded.


FINDINGS
Only 8 studies were included: 4 Level I, 2 Level III, and 2 Level IV studies. The outcomes of these studies suggest that weighted blankets have the potential to be beneficial in limited settings and populations.


CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE
Weighted blankets may be an appropriate therapeutic tool in reducing anxiety; however, there is not enough evidence to suggest they are helpful with insomnia.


WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS
Evidence-based research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets in reducing anxiety and insomnia is sparse. More research is needed to define guidelines for the use of weighted blankets in clinical practice and to investigate the underlying mechanism of action. This systematic review can be used to begin an investigation of the use of weighted blankets for larger and more diverse populations.","Weighted blankets may help reduce anxiety, but there is not enough evidence to suggest they are helpful with insomnia.",question,2033,118.0

In the process, we argue that Schlesinger's typology of political ambition should be expanded to include intrainstitutional ambition--the members' desire for leadership positions within their present institution. Using data on U.S. House members we conclude that intrainstitutional ambition is distinct from both progressive and static ambition with each type of ambition exhibiting unique effects on various measures of legislative behavior.","Ambition affects legislators' behavior, with intrainstitutional ambition being distinct from progressive and static ambition, each having unique effects on legislative behavior.",phrase,682,177.0

A sample of 2-year-old children and their mothers (N= 166) in Beijing and Shanghai, People’s Republic of China, participated in the study. Information on maternal child-rearing attitudes and mother–child attachment relationships was obtained from mothers’ reports. Data concerning maternal parenting strategies, child behaviours, and child reactions to maternal reunion were collected from observations. The results indicated that maternal authoritative attitudes were associated with low power parenting strategies, whereas maternal authoritarian attitudes were associated with enforcement and prohibitory strategies. It was also found that maternal attitudes were associated with child behaviours through the mediation of parenting strategies. However, maternal attitudes might contribute uniquely to mother–child relationships, over and above maternal behaviours. The study provided evidence on the internal coherence of authoritative and authoritarian patterns and their differential significance for child development in urban China.",Maternal authoritarian attitudes are associated with enforcement and prohibitory parenting strategies in urban China.,question,1216,117.0

4525,what does the research say about risk for patients receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy?,Effect of High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy in Immunocompromised Subjects With Acute Respiratory Failure,"BACKGROUND: Various studies have been performed to examine the effect of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). However, the results were inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of HFNC oxygen therapy in immunocompromised patients with ARF versus conventional oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV). METHODS: Relevant studies published prior to May 11, 2019, were systematically searched. The primary outcome was intubation rate; secondary outcomes were mortality (ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 90-d mortality) and ICU-acquired infections. Data were pooled using the random effects model. RESULTS: Of 832 identified studies, 8 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis (N = 2,167 subjects). HFNC was associated with lower intubation rates compared to conventional oxygen therapy (risk ratio [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.00, P = .040), but we found no significant difference in the rate between HFNC and NIV (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46–1.19, P = .22). We also found that HFNC did not increase the risk of ICU-acquired infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63–1.18, P = .35). However, in comparison to other noninvasive therapies, HFNC exhibited no differences in ICU mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58–1.17, P = .28), in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74–1.15, P = .48), or 90-d mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81–1.18, P = .82). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HFNC may be a feasible alternative to NIV, with lower intubation rates and no increased risk for ICU-acquired infections compared to standard oxygen therapy. However, HFNC did not appear to reduce mortality in immunocompromised subjects with ARF compared with other noninvasive therapies. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials should be performed to confirm these findings.",HFNC may lower intubation rates and not increase the risk of ICU-acquired infections compared to standard oxygen therapy.,question,1851,121.0

10702,russia-ukraine war cause inflation?,Inflation in North America: A Critical Review and Analysis of the Year 2022,"The year 2022 has been a year of unprecedented change and global unrest. The world is still struggling to recover from the first global pandemic in over a century and the coordinated global response thereof which changed both the social and the economic landscapes.  Amid this recovery, the world economy has been hit by the Russia-Ukraine war, the effect of climate change on agriculture, citizen unrest and leadership changes in nations across the globe, global supply-chain disruptions, and record-high inflation. This review presents a comparative analysis of the causes/impacts of inflation during 2022 in North America as well as discusses mitigation strategies proposed by the nations therein. Monetarism is used to review North America’s responses to the high inflation rates. Findings indicate that the causes for inflation in North America were very similar for all three countries. These causes included disruption in the supply chain, an excessive rise in demand over supply, the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war, the lingering effects of the governmental response to Covid-19, a tight labor market, expansionary monetary policies by the central banks, and the global impact of drought on agriculture. Our findings also show that the impact of this record-high inflation aligned across all three countries like elevated food prices, housing/rental costs, energy costs, gas prices, household operational costs, healthcare insurance, education cost, and increased poverty, especially among low and fixed-income earners. The central banks of all three countries are using monetary policies to mitigate the situation by increasing their interest rates. However, monetary policies on their own cannot solve the situation and must be complemented by fiscal policies.  This can be evidenced by the intervention of all three governments in the high-inflation challenge.  Nevertheless, this review is limited to North America, thus, it will be essential for future research to focus on other countries and regional blogs.","The Russia-Ukraine war contributed to inflation in North America, along with supply chain disruptions, excessive demand, Covid-19 response effects, tight labor market, and expansionary monetary policies.",phrase,2025,203.0

8241,what are the benefits of learner-centered pedagogy?,Developing Learner-Centred Education among Secondary Trainee Teachers in Malawi: The Dilemma of Appropriation and Application.,"This article is mainly concerned with the capability of trainee teachers to implement learner-centred practice at one of the teacher education institutions in Malawi. The notion of learner-centred education has assumed a positive policy position for teaching and learning in both primary and secondary sectors not only in Malawi, but also in the wider world. However, there is no clear evidence on the extent to which trainee teachers or indeed qualified teachers develop and utilise learner-centred education during their classroom pedagogical practices. The appropriation and application of a pedagogical theory involves adopting tools for thinking that are made available by various social agents, structures and systems within cultural learning settings. The findings in the study indicate that appropriation and application of learner-centred education is constrained by various factors. These findings resonate with findings from other countries and indicate that progressive pedagogical notions aligned with social constructivism promoted in teacher education institutions have not resulted in widespread change in classroom practice. Teacher educators and policy makers need to be aware of this and examine relevant ways and possibly adaptations that can be reasonably made to ensure that secondary teaching appropriately benefits from the strength of learner-centred pedagogy.","Learner-centered pedagogy is positively positioned for teaching and learning, but its application is constrained by various factors, limiting widespread change in classroom practice.",question,1385,182.0
23305,does social media affect body dissatisfaction,Facebook is Linked to Body Dissatisfaction: Comparing Users and Non-Users,"Growing media consumption and emerging forms of social media such as Facebook allow for unprecedented appearance-based social comparison with peers, family, and the wider media. We hypothesise that, for adult men and women, body dissatisfaction is related to peer-based media just as it is to traditional media forms. We expect that middle-aged women in particular are a vulnerable population, due to increasing pressure to conform to youthful beauty standards. In a national sample of New Zealand adults collected in 2012 (N = 11,017), we test the cross-sectional links between being a Facebook user and body satisfaction for men and women across age cohorts. Using a Bayesian regression model testing curvilinear effects of age, we show that having and using a Facebook profile is associated with poorer body satisfaction for both men and women, and across all ages. For women who use Facebook, a U-shaped curvilinear relationship was found between age and body satisfaction; thus the gap between non-users and users in body satisfaction was exacerbated among middle-aged women. A possible cohort effect also indicated that young women tend to be lower in body satisfaction overall. These findings add to the extant literature by suggesting that new media exposure may be associated with lower body satisfaction for some populations more than others, and emphasise the importance of examining body satisfaction in older populations.","Having and using a Facebook profile is associated with poorer body satisfaction for both men and women, and across all ages.",question,1434,124.0

3746,are gay couples more prone to cheating?,"Upset Over Sexual versus Emotional Infidelity Among Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Heterosexual Adults","One hypothesis derived from evolutionary perspectives is that men are more upset than women by sexual infidelity and women are more upset than men by emotional infidelity. The proposed explanation is that men, in contrast to women, face the risk of unwittingly investing in genetically unrelated offspring. Most studies, however, have relied on small college or community samples of heterosexual participants. We examined upset over sexual versus emotional jealousy among 63,894 gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual participants. Participants imagined which would upset them more: their partners having sex with someone else (but not falling in love with them) or their partners falling in love with someone else (but not having sex with them). Consistent with this evolutionary perspective, heterosexual men were more likely than heterosexual women to be upset by sexual infidelity (54 vs. 35 %) and less likely than heterosexual women to be upset by emotional infidelity (46 vs. 65 %). This gender difference emerged across age groups, income levels, history of being cheated on, history of being unfaithful, relationship type, and length. The gender difference, however, was limited to heterosexual participants. Bisexual men and women did not differ significantly from each other in upset over sexual infidelity (30 vs. 27 %), regardless of whether they were currently dating a man (35 vs. 29 %) or woman (28 vs. 20 %).

Home team crowd support has been shown to be a likely causal factor and its influence on referee decision-making appears to play a significant role. Match data from the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League and Europa League were used to investigate referee bias in terms of the association between match location (home vs. away) and disciplinary sanctions used by football referees. The adjusted mean number of yellow cards received by home and away teams and the ratios of these means were estimated from Poisson regression models. After controlling for within-match measures of attacking dominance referees in the Champions League and Europa League issued 25% (p<0.001) and 10% (p=0.002) more yellow cards, respectively, to away teams than to home teams. The higher level of home team bias in the Champions League appeared to be mainly due to higher crowd densities. In a combined analysis of both UEFA leagues the magnitude of referee bias increased with increasing crowd density (p<0.001). Crowd size and crowd proximity were not associated with referee bias after controlling for crowd density. These results provide further evidence that crowd support influences referee decisions. Failure to control for within-match team performance may over-estimate the extent of referee bias in terms of the number of disciplinary sanctions used.",Crowd support contributes to the home advantage in soccer by encouraging players' performance and biasing referee decisions in favor of the home team.,question,1521,150.0
14358,how is copper linked to the immune system,Bacterial Copper Resistance and Virulence,"Copper is essential for most organisms. However, it is also toxic even at low levels, especially when its local concentration or intracellular distribution is not properly controlled. Similar to other organisms, bacteria have evolved specific copper homeostasis systems for maintaining a suitable intracellular concentration of this essential metal and at the same time, avoiding its toxic effects. Recent evidence indicates that intracellular copper actively contributes to the host innate immune response against bacterial infections and pathogens have acquired specific mechanisms to deal with this intoxicant. Here, we focus on the different arrays of metal sensing and regulatory systems employed by bacterial pathogens to mount the proper response to counteract the toxic effects of copper allowing survival and replication inside the host.","Intracellular copper actively contributes to the host innate immune response against bacterial infections, and pathogens have acquired specific mechanisms to counteract its toxic effects.",question,846,187.0

9107,does spanking positively impact childhood development?,Spanking and young children’s socioemotional development in low- and middle-income countries,"Spanking is one of the most common forms of child discipline used by parents around the world. Research on children in high-income countries has shown that parental spanking is associated with adverse child outcomes, yet less is known about how spanking is related to child well-being in low- and middle-income countries. This study uses data from 215,885 children in 62 countries from the fourth and fifth rounds of UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) to examine the relationship between spanking and child well-being. In this large international sample which includes data from nearly one-third of the world’s countries, 43% of children were spanked, or resided in a household where another child was spanked, in the past month. Results from multilevel models show that reports of spanking of children in the household were associated with lower scores on a 3-item socioemotional development index among 3- and 4-year-old children. Country-level results from the multilevel model showed 59 countries (95%) had a negative relationship between spanking and socioemotional development and 3 countries (5%) had a null relationship. Spanking was not associated with higher socioemotional development for children in any country. While the cross-sectional association between spanking and socio-emotional development is small, findings suggest that spanking may be harmful for children on a more global scale than was previously known.",Spanking is associated with lower scores on a socioemotional development index among 3- and 4-year-old children in low- and middle-income countries.,question,1446,148.0
454,do community early interventions work to reduce school exclusions,Multilevel evaluation of factors predicting school exclusion among middle and high school students,"School exclusion (out-of-school suspension and expulsion) is the most common and serious discipline response to student misbehavior. While most existing studies have considered student and school level risk factors for exclusion separately, multilevel analysis that evaluates student and school level variables together is needed since students are nested within their schools. This article addresses this need by using multilevel modeling to predict the likelihood of school exclusion following the last infraction of the year for 9706 middle and high school students in one school district. Multilevel modeling shows that students' poverty, previous suspensions, and severity of the last infraction predict exclusion while the schools' duplicated suspension rate predicts exclusion at the school level. These results highlight the need for comprehensive interventions that seek to change student behavior as well as the school environment. The role of school administrators, faculty and staff in developing and implementing these interventions and other implications for school personnel are discussed.",Comprehensive interventions targeting student behavior and school environment are needed to reduce school exclusions.,question,1104,117.0

Both significantly increased IEC-6 cell proliferation. Neither EGF nor TNF-alpha overcame the inhibitory effect on growth exerted by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Immunoblots with phosphotyrosine antibodies showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IEC-6 cell proteins in response to EGF and TNF-alpha stimulation. TNF-alpha increased ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK phosphorylation. A MAPK assay confirmed the increased activity upon TNF-alpha stimulation. Selective inhibition of MAPK activation by PD98059 resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of TNF-alpha or EGF-induced IEC-6 cell growth.

A Game in Which Native and Invasive Plants Compete Under Multiple Disturbance Regimes","Invasive plants can significantly degrade wildlife habitat, alter soil nutrient cycling, increase the risk of wildfires and floods, consume large amounts of water, and disrupt other ecosystem services. In some instances, managing invasives may be difficult or impossible depending on the scale of the invasion and the amount of time and funding available to address the problem. Furthermore, environmental conditions created by disturbances (e.g., flood, fire) and anthropogenic impacts (e.g., pollution, livestock grazing) can alter the competitive balance between native and invasive plants and either help or complicate management efforts. This chapter describes an interactive game designed to introduce students to the causes, consequences, and management of exotic plant invasions in the context of different ecosystem perturbations. Students will learn about plant community dynamics with a focus on competition between invasive and native plants, the impacts of disturbances on interspecific interactions, and the challenges and threats facing the management and conservation of native vegetation and ecosystem services. After completing the activity, students should be able to (1) define and differentiate among the characteristics of native, exotic, and invasive species; (2) define and distinguish between the effects of anthropogenic impacts and natural disturbances on ecosystems (e.g., fire disturbance, pollution, grazing); and (3) analyze how different environmental conditions created by disturbances and human activities might cause changes in the local abundance and spatial extent of native and invasive plants.","Invasive plants can degrade wildlife habitat, alter soil nutrient cycling, increase wildfire and flood risks, consume water, and disrupt ecosystem services, with disturbances and human activities affecting their spread.",phrase,1632,219.0

8141,are there any health benefits to reducing seed oil consumption,Chemical and Nutritional Characterization of Seed Oil from Cucurbita maxima L. (var. Berrettina) Pumpkin,"Pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) has received considerable attention in recent years because of the nutritional and health-protective value of seed oil. The nutritional composition of pumpkin native to central Italy, locally known as “Berrettina” (Cucurbita maxima L.), was evaluated. In particular, the lipid fraction of seed oil was characterized, and the triacylglycerol (TAG) was thoroughly studied by using a stereospecific procedure to obtain the intrapositional fatty acid composition of the three sn-positions of the glycerol backbone of TAG. Moreover, alkaline hydrolysis was carried out to study the main components of the unsaponifiable fraction, i.e., sterols and alcohols. It was observed that monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids were the most abundant (41.7% and 37.2%, respectively) in Berrettina pumpkin seed oil, with high content of oleic and linoleic acid (41.4% and 37.0%, respectively). The main sterols of Berrettina pumpkin seed oil were Δ7,22,25-stigmastatrienol, Δ7,25-stigmastadienol, and spinasterol; with regard to the alcoholic fraction, triterpenic compounds were more abundant than aliphatic compounds (63.2% vs. 36.8%). The obtained data are useful to evaluate pumpkin seed oil from a nutritional point of view. The oil obtained from the seed could be used as a preservative and as a functional ingredient in different areas, e.g., cosmetics, foods, and nutraceuticals.","Berrettina pumpkin seed oil is rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have nutritional and health-protective value.",question,1417,139.0

Due to the similarities between plantar fasciopathy and tendinopathies, the aim of this trial was to investigate the acute effect of isometric exercise on pain, compared to isotonic exercise, or walking, in individuals with plantar fasciopathy. We recruited 20 individuals with plantar fasciopathy for this prospectively‐registered, participant‐blinded, randomized, superiority crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03264729). Participants attended three exercise sessions (isometric, isotonic, or walking) in a randomized order, within a 2‐week period. Both isometric and isotonic exercises were performed standing with the forefoot on a step bench, while walking was performed barefoot. The primary outcome was pain (measured on a 0‐100‐mm VAS) during a pain‐aggravating activity. Secondary outcomes included pressure pain threshold (PPT) under the heel, and plantar fascia thickness (PFT). All outcomes were measured before and after each exercise session. There were no significant differences between the three exercises on pain (P = 0.753), PPTs (P = 0.837), or PFT (P = 0.718). Further, there was no change in pain from before to after any of the exercises (isometric exercise 2.7 mm [95% CI: −12.2; 6.8], isotonic exercise −3.4 mm [95% CI: −5.0; 11.8], or walking 1.6 mm [95% CI: −16.1; 12.9]).

Central aortic pressures are often more sensitive clinical and prognostic factors than peripheral pressures, while arterial stiffness is an independent prognostic factor for cardiovascular events. Great efforts are being made to find natural sources of improving health. In order to clarify the mechanisms under which a widely used drink, like red wine, is affecting heart and vessels, we aimed to review the available data regarding the effects of red wine on arterial stiffness, wave reflections and central blood pressures. The effect of red wine on central hemodynamics has been poorly explored with divergent results. Possible consequences of acute and long-term intake on arterial stiffness, wave reflections and central pressures are not clear.

Calculating the right sample size is crucial to gaining accurate information and ensures that research resources are used efficiently and ethically. The simple question “How many subjects do I need?” does not always have a simple answer. Before calculating the sample size requirements, a researcher must address several aspects, such as purpose of the research (descriptive or comparative), type of samples (one or more groups), and data being collected (continuous or categorical). In this article, we describe some of the most frequent methods for calculating the sample size with examples from nuclear cardiology research, including for t tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), non-parametric tests, correlation, Chi-squared tests, and survival analysis.

Consistent with the view that information about a public or private good can function as a persuasive communication, willingness to pay (WTP) was found to increase with the quality of arguments used to describe the good, especially under conditions of high personal relevance. Under low personal relevance, WTP for a public (but not for a private) good was higher when an altruistic, as opposed to an individualistic, orientation was activated. It is concluded that the nature of the information provided in CV surveys can profoundly affect WTP estimates, and that subtle contextual cues can seriously bias these estimates under conditions of low personal relevance.","Willingness to pay (WTP) increases with the quality of arguments used to describe the good, especially under conditions of high personal relevance.",question,773,147.0

Forty-two snoring men, mean age 45 years and mean body mass index 26 kg.m-2, slept every night during one month with the Nozovent nostril dilator. Before and at the end of the test period, we analysed serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (free T4), free 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (free T3), cortisol and testosterone in blood sampled at 08:00 h. Fifteen of the 37 snoring men who completed the study experienced a reduction in snoring and were less tired in the morning during the test period. In this group, the mean IGF-1 concentration was significantly increased (p < 0.05) after one month. There was no significant difference in mean IGF-1 level between the snorers and a population sample. Likewise, TSH, free T4, free T3, cortisol and testosterone concentrations were within normal limits.

The book draws on a broad range of comparative research into audience engagement with news, across different geographic regions, to provide insight into the experience of news audiences in the twenty-first century. 
 
From its inception, it was imagined that the Internet would benignly transform the nature of news media and its consumers. There were predictions that it would, for example, break up news oligarchies, improve plurality and diversity through news personalisation, create genuine social solidarity online, and increase political awareness and participation among citizens. However, this book finds that, while mainstream news media is still the major source of news, the new media environment appears to lead to greater polarisation between news junkies and news avoiders, and to greater political polarisation. The authors also argue that the dominant role of the USA in the field of news audience research has created myths about a global news audience, which obscures the importance of national context as a major explanation for news exposure differences.

14375,what is the treatment for pakinson's disease?,521. Helper-dependent adenovirus with gene switch regulation may provide an optimal vector of therapeutic gene delivery for treatment of Parkinson's disease|[ast]|,"Gene therapy is considered one of the most promising approaches to developing a novel effective treatment for Pakinson[rsquo]s disease (PD). However, the potential unwanted side effect from viral vector or from the over expression of the transgenes are the major concerns for the future clinical applications. Thus, investigating the optimal vector for gene delivery with a controllable transgene expression mechanism is important. We had reported that helper-dependent adenovirus (hdAd), a novel adenoviral construct with full deletion of viral coding sequences, is an optimal vector to deliver the gene in the lateral ventricle with less immunogenecity and toxicity while offering extended transgene expression (Hum Gene Ther 2001;12). In present study, we injected this vector into the rat striatum to examine the transgene expression profile and the inflammatory response. We also have investigated whether mifepristone-mediated gene switch can be applied in regulating the transgene expression. HdAdv/LacZ vectors were constructed and amplified with the Cre/loxP system as described previously (Mol Ther 2000; 2). Three concentrations of hdAdv/LacZ (1X107, 1X108, and 1X109 particles/ul) were administrated into striatum of rats. After 3days, 7 days, 30days, 60days and 90days post-injection, hdAdv/LacZ expression was quantified by X-gal staining. For the gene switch studies, we have tested the mifepristone-regulated transgene expression in the CNS cell cultures and in animal model study. Different doses of mifepristone were administrated and the transgene expression levels were measured by transgene expression assays. Our results demonstrate that intrastriatal inoculation of hdAdv vector produced a potent transgene expression with minimal inflammatory responses. The hdAdv/lacZ can retrograde transport to the substantia nigra 3-day after intrastriatal injection and last for a long period. The potency of the transgene expression is dose dependent. In in vitro studies, we have found that mifepristone induced a 28-fold higher level of transgene expression in cultures transducted with the gene switch vector, compared with non-mifepristone-treated cultures. The transgene expression levels are mifepristone dose dependent. The results are also confirmed in in vivo study. The preliminary results suggest that mifepristone-induced gene switch system could efficiently induce transgene expression. HdAdv with gene switch system may provide an optimal vector for therapeutic gene delivery for treatment of PD. The next step is to study the therapeutic effects of intrastriatal delivery of hdAdv/GDNF with mifepristone induced gene switch element in PD animal models.",Helper-dependent adenovirus with gene switch regulation may provide an optimal vector for therapeutic gene delivery in Parkinson's disease treatment.,question,2680,149.0
8306,do conscientious objection laws harm sexual minority health?,Objeção da consciência e aborto previsto em lei : vivências em um serviço público de saúde,"INTRODUCTION: Conscientious objection has emerged and consolidated according to the requirements arising from the exercise of citizenship in a Democratic Constitutional State. It can be declared whenever a person or a group of people are faced with conflicting issues that go against their personal beliefs in situations such as compulsory military service, coping with extreme situations such as euthanasia, prenatal care or abortion, object of this work. Most of these tensions arises in health care, confronting opposing positions, which causes conflicts of difficult moral mediation. Bioethics offers tools to intermediate ideological, moral, religious and philosophical conflicts, promoting advocacy and contributing to the achievement of the secular state and conscientious objection. The health professional experiences challenging situations, however, conscientious objection should not put at risk the health care process, right guaranteed by law for all people. Generally, the conscientious objector declares its position in situations such as abortion provided by law, which is a right of Brazilian woman, in case of pregnancy resulting from sexual violence, risk of death for women and anencephaly. OBJECTIVE: To know and understand the existence of conscientious objection on abortion provided by law in a public hospital. METHODS: exploratory, descriptive research, developed through multidimensional research on a pragmatic conception, based on the use of mixed methods. RESULTS: The results of the integrative review (article 1) revealed that the appropriation of Objection of Conscience concept by health professionals is incipient. Nurses anchor its meaning based on the Code of Ethics of Nursing Professionals. The article 2 presented the profile of the women who underwent the termination of pregnancy from 2007 to 2013. The pregnancy was, for the most part, a result of extra-familial sexual violence, stopped up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, and 7.4% of pregnancy interruptions deviated from the protocol used for uterine evacuation. Most women said they were of evangelical religion and mulatto, aged between 26 and 35 years old, did not record police report. The qualitative research revealed that the team that welcomed these women by the time of abandonment suffered from the difficulty of coping in this delicate moment of women’s lives. CONCLUSION: Nurses presented more difficulty to understand the right to the objection of conscience by little ownership to everyday practice and have limited knowledge of the Code of Ethics that incorporates the idea in the case of abortion. Compliance with the protocol for the time of uterine evacuation, according to the technical standard, is still not solid. Intra and extra-institutional discussions about the subject of conscientious objection and its relationship to abortion provided by law are necessary, in order to guarantee the right to bioethical principles of women and girls who seek the service.

9443,why do societies collapse?,Ecological collapses of past civilizations.,"A justification frequently offered for studying history is that it gives us the opportunity to learn from human errors in the past. Until recently, though, it appeared that we had nothing to learn from the past about how to avoid the environmental predicament in which all human societies now find themselves. The greatest risk to humanity in coming decades is that we may continue to damage our environment to a degree where our current standard of living or even our existence becomes impossible. That dilemma has seemed a unique one in human history, a consequence of our uniquely high modern numbers coupled with our uniquely destructive modern technology. However, it is now being realized that many past societies did collapse through destroying their environmental underpinnings, and that we thus do have environmental lessons to learn from our past. This is a burgeoning area of paleontology and archaeology, with most of the compelling evidence having been gathered only within the last 12 years. I accept the following definition of a ""collapse of society"": a local drastic decrease in human population numbers and/or in political, economic, or social complexity. Collapse can even reach the point that human population completely disappears over a considerable area. By this definition, it is evident that many societies have collapsed.

11135,Is fish oil good for heart health?,Effects of a fish oil supplement on blood pressure and serum lipids in patients treated for coronary artery disease.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a concentrate of fish oil on blood pressure and serum lipids in patients treated for coronary artery disease.


DESIGN
One hundred and twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive 15 g/day MaxEPA (4.5 g eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) or olive oil. Blood pressure and serum lipids were measured at enrollment and six months thereafter.


MAIN RESULTS
As an important proportion of antihypertensive or antianginal drug users stopped their usual medication during the trial, blood pressure increased in both groups. The increase in systolic blood pressure was less in the fish oil group than in the control group (P = 0.002). Serum triglyceride levels decreased markedly in the fish oil group while they remained constant in the control group (P = 0.0001). Fish oil supplementation had no effect on total cholesterol and only marginal independent influence on high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.


CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, fish oil supplementation has a beneficial effect on blood pressure and serum triglycerides in patients treated for coronary artery disease.",Fish oil supplementation has a beneficial effect on blood pressure and serum triglycerides in patients treated for coronary artery disease.,question,1188,139.0

Evidence shows that sleep deprivation (SD) negatively affects mental health and impairs cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Furthermore, the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is a metabolic biomarker, which is affected by various conditions, including stress, sleep deprivation, and cognitive and psychiatric disorders. In this research, we investigated the effect of SD and reverse circadian (RC), and two models of napping (continuous and non-continuous) combined with SD or RC on fear-conditioning memory, anxiety-like behavior and mGluR5 fluctuations in the amygdala. 64 male Wistar rats were used in this study. The water box apparatus was used to induce SD/RC for 48 hours, and fear-conditioning memory apparatus was used to assess fear memory. The results showed, fear-conditioning memory was impaired following SD and RC, especially in contextual stage. However, anxiety-like behavior was increased. Furthermore, mGluR5 was increased in the left amygdala more than the right amygdala. Additionally, continuous napping significantly improved fear-conditioning memory, especially freezing behavior. In conclusion, following SD and RC, fear-conditioning memory in contextual stage is more vulnerable than in auditory stage. Furthermore, increase in anxiety-like behavior is related to increase in the activity of left amygdala and mGluR5 receptors.","Sleep deprivation negatively affects mental health and impairs cognitive functions, including learning and memory.",question,1464,114.0

Participants completed the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and had a clinical examination including the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need- Dental Health Component (IOTN-DHC). Data analyses included descriptive statistics, One-way ANOVA and bivariate and multivariate regression models.ResultsThe mean overall score (± SD) for OHIP-14 in young people aged 15–25 was 22.6 ± 12.5. The psychological discomfort domain was the domain where highest impact was recorded with a mean (± SD) of 4.0 ± 1.9. The regression analyses showed a significant association of IOTN-DHC with overall OHIP-14 score (p < 0.05). Although females reported a slightly higher impact than males, this was not significant in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Age group had a significant negative association with overall OHIP-14 score (p < 0.05). The 15–18 year old group showed the highest impact on their quality of life due to malocclusion. Participants with a university education report a significantly higher impact on OHRQoL as compared to participants with only secondary education.ConclusionMalocclusion has a significant negative impact on OHRQoL and its domains.

1589,are humans are divided into biological races?,"Cultural Neuroscience: Connecting Culture, Brain, and Genes","Cultural neuroscience emerged during the past decade at the intersection of cultural psychology, several subfields of human neuroscience, genetics, and epigenetics. In the present essay, we define the field, provide a selective review of its empirical accomplishment, and discuss its future directions. Cultural neuroscience conceptualizes the human mind as biologically prepared and grounded and, at the same time, as socially and culturally shaped and completed. This young field initially started as an effort to expand preceding behavioral work in cultural psychology with novel brain imaging methods. Increasingly, however, the field is poised to address the interplay between biology, environment, and behavior, as shown in our review of recent empirical work on (i) culture and the self, (ii) culture and genes, and (iii) multicultural identity. The future of the field hinges on several key initiatives including the use of brain stimulation methods, expansion of its database to cultures other than North America and Asia, and a more comprehensive analysis of gene–culture coevolution. In conclusion, we observe that further investigation of culture, brain, and genes may lead to an important insight that to study cultural diversity is no less to affirm the unity of humans as a common biological species.

21589,benefits of lean construction,Empirical Assessment of the Impact of VDC and Lean on Environment and Waste in Masonry Operations,"Lean principles aim to improve construction through focus on value and waste elimination, which benefits environmental performance by reducing life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving other environmental metrics. Although prior research identified relationships between Lean, BIM and sustainability, most studies were qualitative assessments of the value of lean and VDC management. In this study we measured the impact of Lean and VDC on waste in operations, and on GHG emissions, of masonry partitions. Researchers observed workers and classified their activities as value-adding or non-value-adding. Data from three different projects that include combinations of Lean and VDC implementation were used to estimate the efficiency of operations in comparison to earlier construction projects from 2007 to 2014 that implemented the same methods. The results were eye-opening: implementing Lean principles and VDC raised the proportion of value–adding activities to 68.4%, compared to only 35.8% in traditional management. Moreover, Lean and VDC methods contributed to reduce wasted global warming potential (GWP) from 169 kg CO2e/m3 of partition built to 112 kg CO2e/m3, an environmental improvement of 34%.

8930,does guaranteed instructional planning time help with teacher stress?,"Child Behavior Problems, Teacher Executive Functions, and Teacher Stress in Head Start Classrooms","Research Findings: The current article explores the relationship between teachers’ perceptions of child behavior problems and preschool teacher job stress, as well as the possibility that teachers’ executive functions moderate this relationship. Data came from 69 preschool teachers in 31 early childhood classrooms in 4 Head Start centers and were collected using Web-based surveys and Web-based direct assessment tasks. Multilevel models revealed that higher levels of teachers’ perceptions of child behavior problems were associated with higher levels of teacher job stress and that higher teacher executive function skills were related to lower job stress. However, findings did not yield evidence for teacher executive functions as a statistical moderator. Practice or Policy: Many early childhood teachers do not receive sufficient training for handling children's challenging behaviors. Child behavior problems increase a teacher's workload and consequently may contribute to feelings of stress. However, teachers’ executive function abilities may enable them to use effective, cognitive-based behavior management and instructional strategies during interactions with students, which may reduce stress. Providing teachers with training on managing challenging behaviors and enhancing executive functions may reduce their stress and facilitate their use of effective classroom practices, which is important for children's school readiness skills and teachers’ health.",Higher teacher executive function skills are related to lower job stress.,question,1473,73.0

9658,Does NO3 improve exercise performance?,Dietary Nitrate Supplementation and Exercise-Related Performance,"Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the utility of nitrate (NO3−) supplementation to improve exercise-related performance. After consumption, dietary NO3− can be reduced to nitric oxide, a free radical gas involved in numerous physiological actions including blood vessel vasodilation, mitochondrial respiration, and skeletal muscle contractile function. Emerging evidence indicates that dietary NO3− supplementation has a small but nevertheless significant beneficial effect on endurance performance through the combined effects of enhanced tissue oxygenation and metabolic efficiency in active skeletal muscle. There is further evidence to suggest that dietary NO3− exerts a direct influence on contractile mechanisms within the skeletal muscle through alterations in calcium availability and sensitivity. Response heterogeneity and sizeable variability in the nitrate content of beetroot juice products influence the effectiveness of dietary NO3− for exercise performance, and so dosing and product quality, as well as training history, sex, and individual-specific characteristics, should be considered.",Dietary NO3- supplementation has a small but significant beneficial effect on endurance performance through enhanced tissue oxygenation and metabolic efficiency in active skeletal muscle.,question,1130,187.0

16685,DO probiotics actually help gut health?,Probiotics: Current knowledge update,"Probiotics are dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacteria or yeasts. They are administered in different quantities that allow for colon colonization. These products help in stimulating health promoting flora and also suppressing the pathologic colonization and disease spread. Probiotics are ""live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host."" The term ""probiotic"" was first used in 1965, by Lilly and Stillwell, to describe substances secreted by one organism which stimulates the growth of another. The use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy, and irradiation, among other means of treatment, may cause alterations in the composition and have an effect on the gut flora. Therefore, the introduction of beneficial bacterial species to gastrointestinal tract may be a very attractive option to reestablish the microbial equilibrium and prevent disease. Probiotics are not the same thing as prebiotics - nondigestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms already in people′s colons. When probiotics and prebiotics are mixed together, they form a symbiotic. The use of probiotic plays an important aspect in dentistry too ever since the oral infections occupied the prime space among the other infections effecting the humans. This concept of microbial ecologic change both for medical and dental changes has accumulated a lot of evidence in recent times.

Background Myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium in the absence of ischemic injury, may be caused by viruses, drugs, and vaccines. The Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccinations is most commonly seen in young adult males and commonly after the second dose of the mRNA vaccine. It usually presents with chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations but has a diverse clinical presentation and varied therapeutic response. We aim to systematically collate the symptomatology, prognosis, and clinical findings of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events causing Myocarditis. Method Following the PRISMA statement 2020, a systematic search was conducted to isolate confirmed cases of COVID-19 vaccine-induced Myocarditis. By applying the BOOLEAN logic, the following keywords were used: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Myocarditis, Mortality. Four databases were searched from January 2021 through August 2021: PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library; the reference lists of screened studies were searched as well (umbrella methodology). Results In total, 12 case reports, 10 case series and 1 cohort study with a total of 107 patients were included in the final analysis. A total of 101 male patients were recorded, and 6 were female showing male dominance. The mean age of all participants was 24.73 years(SD = 13.18), ranging from 14 to 70. The most common presenting symptoms were chest pain (47.66%), fever (35.51%), and myalgia (25.23%). Lab findings showed elevated Troponin I, CRP, and ESR levels in the majority of patients. ECG was abnormal in most of the patients, which include sinus rhythm (24%), ST-elevation (42.05%) and T wave inversion (13.08%). Echo findings include decreased Ejection fraction in 19.62% of patients while 13.08% of patients having a hypokinetic left ventricular wall. Further, CMR finding suggestive of confirmed myocarditis cases in 36% patients while rest are suspected one. Overall mortality(1.86%) was low among patients. Conclusion There is increasing evidence for Myocarditis as a rare adverse event of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in young adults. This evidence is strongest amongst young male patients. The majority of the patients complain of chest pain and fever. In lab findings Troponin I, CRP and ESR are usually increased and ST elevation is common in the ECG.

19920,how to define free-ranging-dogs?,Free-ranging dogs understand human intentions and adjust their behavioral responses accordingly,"Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are remarkably sensitive and responsive while interacting with humans. Pet dogs are known to have social skills and abilities to display situation-specific responses, but there is lack of information regarding free-ranging dogs which constitute majority of the world’s dog population. Free-ranging dogs found in most of the developing countries interact constantly with familiar and unfamiliar humans receiving both positive and negative behavior. Thus, understanding human intentions and subsequent behavioral adjustments are crucial for dogs that share habitats with humans. Here we subjected free-ranging dogs to different human social communicative cues (friendly and threatening – low and high), followed by a food provisioning phase and tested their responsiveness. Dogs exhibited higher proximity seeking behavior as a reaction to friendly gesture whereas, they were prompted to maintain distance depending on the impact of the threatening cues. Interestingly, only the high-impact threatening showed to have a persistent effect which also remained during the subsequent food provisioning phase. An elevated approach in the food provisioning phase elicited the dependency of free-ranging dogs on humans for sustenance. Our findings suggest that free-ranging dogs demonstrate behavioral plasticity on interacting with humans; which provides significant insights into the establishment of the dog-human relationship on streets.","Free-ranging dogs are those that constantly interact with familiar and unfamiliar humans, sharing habitats with them and demonstrating behavioral plasticity in response to human cues.",question,1471,183.0
11732,can nanobodies (or vhh) enter the blood-brain-barrier?,Abstract T P234: Cell Cycle Inhibition via Blocking Src Family Kinases Promotes Hippocampal Neuron Survival and Improves Cognitive Function after Intraventricular Hemorrhage,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is one of the most serious hemorrhagic brain diseases being associated with blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, brain edema, neuron loss, cognitive impairment and high mortality in humans. Increasing evidence suggests that neuronal cell death ensues when neurons attempt to re-enter the cell cycle. Our previous study has demonstrated that cell cycle inhibition via blocking Src family kinases (SFKs) prevents neuronal cell death. However, one of the concerns with cell cycle therapy might be that it would inhibit proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and that inhibiting neurogenesis would produce cognitive effects related to the therapy itself.
 Using the rodent in vivo IVH model we show that i.p. injection of SFK inhibitor (PP2) prevents IVH-induced death of hippocampal neurons and cognitive deficits assessed on the Morris Water Maze. Moreover, PP2 (i.p.) alone did not affect proliferation of NPCs and did not affect cognition. Since there are several SFK gene family members in brain, we targeted specific SFK subtypes (e.g. Fyn, Lck and c-Src) using a newly developed in vivo nanoparticle-based siRNA transfection system. We show that nanoparticle-siRNA-Fyn plus nanoparticle-siRNA-Src attenuate IVH-induced neuron loss and cognitive deficits. Nanoparticle-siRNA-Fyn nor nanoparticle-siRNA-Src had no significant affects on population of NPCs or cognitive side effects, possibly because the nanoparticle-based siRNA transfection system only produces transient knockdown of the gene targets. This could provide a novel therapy for treating IVH patients as the nanoparticle-based siRNA approach provides heightened specificity for specific SFK gene(s) with less off target effects and this approach has been used in humans.

Over the past threedecades, a converging body of evidence has implicated dietary deficiency in LCn-3 PUFAs in the pathophysiology and etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), and that fish oil supplementation reduces depressive symptoms. Recently emerging neuroimaging evidence further suggests fish oil supplementation promotes neuronal resilience and white-matter integrity. Translational evidence suggests elevated proinflammatory signaling, deficits in cerebral perfusion and glucose utilization, and synaptic regression may mediate the association between LCn-3 PUFA insufficiency and central pathological processes implicated in MDD. Together, this body of evidence provides a strong rationale for identifying and treating LCn-3 PUFA deficiency in patients with or at risk for MDD in a broader effort to optimize treatment and improve long-term health outcomes for patients.",Fish oil supplementation reduces depressive symptoms and promotes neuronal resilience and white-matter integrity.,question,1054,113.0
549,how does social inequality affect the mental health of people in india,Social Vulnerability and Mental Health Inequalities in the “Syndemic”: Call for Action,"Covid-19 is referred to as a “syndemic,” i.e., the consequences of the disease are exacerbated by social and economic disparity. Poor housing, unstable work conditions, caste, class, race and gender based inequities and low incomes have a profound effect on mental health and wellbeing. Such disparities are increasing between, among and within countries and are exacerbated by human rights violations, in institution and in society, stigma and discrimination. Social capital can mediate health outcomes, through trust and reciprocity, political participation, and by mental health service systems, which can be coercive or more open to demand of emancipation and freedom. Societal inequalities affect especially vulnerable groups, and Covid itself had a wider impact on the most socially vulnerable and marginalized populations, suffering for structural discrimination and violence. There are complex relations among these social processes and domains, and mental health inequalities and disparity. Participation and engagement of citizens and community organizations is now required in order to achieve a radical transformation in mental health. A Local and Global Action Plan has been launched recently, by a coalition of organizations representing people with lived experience of mental health care; who use services; family members, mental health professionals, policy makers and researchers, such as the International Mental Health Collaborating Network, the World Federation for Mental Health, the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the Global Alliance of Mental Illness Advocacy Networks (GAMIAN), The Mental Health Resource Hub in Chennai, India, The Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) and others. The Action Plan addresses the need for fundamental change by focusing on social determinants and achieving equity in mental health care. Equally the need for the politics of wellbeing has to be embedded in a system that places mental health within development and social justice paradigm, enhancing core human capabilities and contrasting discriminatory practices. These targets are for people and organizations to adopt locally within their communities and services, and also to indicate possible innovative solutions to Politics.

The sow productivity can be measured as the number or kilograms of pigs born alive and weaned per litter, per year or during the stay in the herd. The effect of year and farm are important sources of variation, are mainly due to climatic changes and differences in management. The effect of season in tropical regions is due to heat stress and high humidity in the hot season. The first parity sows have intervals between farrowing and weaning to conception intervals larger and smaller litters compared to sows. Productivity during the productive life is affected by handling each farm, age and the number of piglets born at first farrowing and cause waste. Most studies are in temperate zones. In conclusion, the productivity of sows is affected by different climatic conditions of each region and management differences between farms in different years and season, as well as by the number of parity, so it is important to characterize the specific conditions of each farm or region.","Sow productivity is affected by climatic conditions, management differences between farms, season, and the number of parity.",question,1152,124.0
23175,legal protection of ai-generated content under ip law,"Ownership, liability, patentability, and creativity issues in artificial intelligence","ABSTRACT While Artificial Intelligence technologies find increasing use in different industries such as transportation, healthcare and other services, it gives rise to legal complexities in respect of ownership and liability of AI, patentability of AI inventions, and creativity & ownership of AI-generated works attributable to various components of AI. The autonomous decision-making ability of AI challenges the existing IP framework. Since AI machines can “think” and “act” without any human effort, if any damage or harm occurs to the properties, does the current model of tort liability (product liability, negligence, strict liability) adequately address the legal concerns? Robust regulatory bodies and institutional mechanisms are required to develop rigorous safety standards and establish safety certification processes for AI.

The clinical benefits of LDL‐C reduction appear to extend even to patients starting with LDL‐C as low as 60–80 mg/dL prior to initiating therapy. Statins are the first‐line agents for treating hypercholesterolemia and are effective in reducing LDL‐C, but many patients are unable to achieve their optimal lipid targets despite intensive statin therapy. Therefore, there has been a strong impetus for the development of novel pharmacologic agents designed to lower LDL‐C further in patients already on statin therapy. Genetic mutations resulting in altered cholesterol homeostasis provide valuable information regarding novel approaches for treating hypercholesterolemia. To that end, mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were linked to altered levels of LDL‐C, illustrating this protein's role in lipid metabolism. PCSK9 promotes degradation of the LDL receptor, preventing its transport back to the cell surface and thereby increasing circulating LDL‐C. Conversely, inhibition of PCSK9 can profoundly decrease circulating LDL‐C, and thus is an attractive new target for LDL‐C–lowering therapy. AMG 145 is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 antibody that binds specifically to human PCSK9 and inhibits its interaction with the low‐density lipoprotein receptor. In this manuscript, we describe the rationale and design of LDL‐C Assessment with PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibody Inhibition Combined With Statin Therapy–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 57 (LAPLACE‐TIMI 57; NCT01380730), a 12‐week, randomized, double‐blind, dose‐ranging, placebo‐controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AMG 145 when added to statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

19654,do interest rates impact inflation?,Impact of Interest Rate and Inflation on Stock Market Index: A Case of Pakistan,"AbstractThe multidimensional impact of inflation has been widely investigated empirically. In continuation of the same, it is argued that inflation has a strong influence over stock market indexes. In this discussion influence of interest rate on stock market index have also a prime importance. This paper attempts to study the impact of interest rate and inflation on stock market index. We have taken KSE100 as dependent variable and CPI, REER, and WALR as independent variables. We have found CPI and WALR statistically significant at 95% level. Our results show the value of R^sup 2^ coefficient of determination as 0.70, which means that 70% variation in KSE100 index is being explained by CPI, REER, and WALR (independent variables). The beta coefficient of inflation shows its positive relationship with KSE100, which means that an increase in inflation can raise the KSE 100 index value. However, persistent inflation will eventually build high future expectations about higher inflation, resulting in a negative impact on KSE100 index. The coefficient of WALR shows a significant and negative relationship of WALR with KSE 100.Keywords: inflation; stock market indexes; interest rate; KSE100; CPI; REER; WALRIntroductionThe impact of inflation and interest rates on the stock market has been of great importance. Persistent increase in current inflation results in increased share prices whereas increase in future expectations of inflation gives opposite results (Feldstein, 1980). The interest rates have different relationships with the stock market depending on their term structure. According to the FED model, the Treasury bond yields and the yield on earnings and dividends on stocks are either equal or highly correlated.Literature ReviewAccording to the FED model, the Treasury bond yields and the yield on earnings and dividends on stocks are either equal or highly correlated.Academics have concluded that the model is inconsistent with a rational valuation of the stock market (see for instance, Asness (2003), Feinman (2005), Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004), Cohen, Polk and Vuolteenaho (2005), Ritter and Warr (2002) and Sharpe (2002)), while some confirmed the viability of the Fed model (see the references in Estrada (2005).Adams et al (2004) found a negative relationship between unexpected inflation and stock prices. They found that any unexpected change PPI and the CPI influences the stock prices negatively. Explaining the time lag between increase in inflation and stock prices reaction they highlighted a time lapse of 10-20 minutes. It means when inflation news is received in the market right after 10-20 minutes of that, stock prices start responding it. He further maintained that the effect of inflation will be deeper if the economy is larger and it will directly vary with the size of economy.Importance of economic uncertainty is discussed by Bansal and Yaron (2004, BY henceforth) and a model of external habit is built by Campbell and Cochrane (1999, CC henceforth), leading to a measure of time-varying risk aversion that can be constructed from current and past consumption data and is countercyclical.Bekaert, Engstrom and Xing (2009) combine both measures in one model. Consequently, a rational channel explains why the Fed model ""works:"" high expected inflation coincides with periods of high risk aversion and/or economic uncertainty. Fama (1981), in proxy hypothesis, argues that the strong negative relationship between stock returns and inflation is due to stock returns anticipating future economic activity and inflation acting as a proxy for expected real activity.Vuolteenaho and John Y (2004) identify that almost 80% time-series variation in stock-market is explained by inflation. Fama (1981) empirically depicts a negative relationship of inflation with stock prices in post 1953 period. He explains that the forecasting in stock prices may be done with the help of change in inflationary expectations. …","An increase in inflation can raise the KSE 100 index value, but persistent inflation will eventually result in a negative impact on the KSE100 index.",question,3966,149.0
1447,does no3 improve exercise performance?,Influence of dietary nitrate supplementation on physiological and muscle metabolic adaptations to sprint interval training.,"We hypothesized that 4 wk of dietary nitrate supplementation would enhance exercise performance and muscle metabolic adaptations to sprint interval training (SIT). Thirty-six recreationally active subjects, matched on key variables at baseline, completed a series of exercise tests before and following a 4-wk period in which they were allocated to one of the following groups: 1) SIT and [Formula: see text]-depleted beetroot juice as a placebo (SIT+PL); 2) SIT and [Formula: see text]-rich beetroot juice (~13 mmol [Formula: see text]/day; SIT+BR); or 3) no training and [Formula: see text]-rich beetroot juice (NT+BR). During moderate-intensity exercise, pulmonary oxygen uptake was reduced by 4% following 4 wk of SIT+BR and NT+BR (P < 0.05) but not SIT+PL. The peak work rate attained during incremental exercise increased more in SIT+BR than in SIT+PL (P < 0.05) or NT+BR (P < 0.001). The reduction in muscle and blood [lactate] and the increase in muscle pH from preintervention to postintervention were greater at 3 min of severe-intensity exercise in SIT+BR compared with SIT+PL and NT+BR (P < 0.05). However, the change in severe-intensity exercise performance was not different between SIT+BR and SIT+PL (P > 0.05). The relative proportion of type IIx muscle fibers in the vastus lateralis muscle was reduced in SIT+BR only (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that BR supplementation may enhance some aspects of the physiological adaptations to SIT.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the influence of nitrate-rich and nitrate-depleted beetroot juice on the muscle metabolic and physiological adaptations to 4 wk of sprint interval training. Compared with placebo, dietary nitrate supplementation reduced the O2 cost of submaximal exercise, resulted in greater improvement in incremental (but not severe-intensity) exercise performance, and augmented some muscle metabolic adaptations to training.

19822,does avoiding red meat improve health?,Adopting a Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern with Different Amounts of Lean Unprocessed Red Meat Does Not Influence Short-Term Subjective Personal Well-Being in Adults with Overweight or Obesity,"ABSTRACT Background Reducing red meat intake is commonly recommended. Limited observational studies suggest that healthy eating patterns with red meat are associated with improved quality of life. Objective The secondary objectives of this randomized crossover controlled-feeding trial were to assess the effects of following a Mediterranean-style eating pattern (Med-Pattern) with different amounts of red meat on indexes of personal well-being (i.e., perceived quality of life, mood, and sleep) in overweight or obese adults. We hypothesized that following a Med-Pattern would improve these outcomes, independent of red meat intake amount. Methods Forty-one participants [aged 46 ± 2 y; body mass index (kg/m2): 30.5 ± 0.6;n = 28 women,n = 13 men) were provided Med-Pattern foods for two 5-wk periods separated by 4 wk of self-selected eating. The Med-Red Pattern contained ∼500 g/wk (typical US intake), and the Med-Control Pattern contained ∼200 g/wk (commonly recommended intake in heart-healthy eating patterns) of lean, unprocessed beef or pork compensated with mainly poultry and dairy. Baseline and postintervention outcomes measured were perceived quality of life via the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2), daily mood states via the Profile of Mood States (POMS), sleep perceptions via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and sleep patterns via actigraphy. Data were analyzed via a doubly repeated-measures ANOVA adjusted for age, sex, and body mass at each time point. Results Following a Med-Pattern did not change domains of physical health, mental health, total mood disturbances, sleep perceptions, and sleep patterns but improved subdomains of physical health role limitations (SF-36v2: 93.6–96.7%;P = 0.038), vitality (SF-36v2: 57.9–63.0%;P = 0.020), and fatigue (POMS: 2.9–2.5 arbitrary units;P = 0.039). There were no differences between the Med-Red and Med-Control Patterns (time × pattern,P-interaction > 0.05). Conclusion Following a Med-Pattern, independent of lean, unprocessed red meat intake, may not be an effective short-term strategy to meaningfully improve indexes of personal well-being in adults who are overweight or obese. This trial was registered atclinicaltrials.gov as NCT02573129.","Following a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, independent of lean, unprocessed red meat intake, may not be an effective short-term strategy to meaningfully improve personal well-being in overweight or obese adults.",question,2243,216.0

6220,what is being happy?,HAPPINESS AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORY,". The article analyzes the research of the category of «happiness»; in particular, psychological characteristics and indicators of a happy life, determines common and different features between such concepts as «happiness», «subjective well-being» and «cheer-fulness». The psychologists propose a model of subjective well-being, which consists of the following main interconnected components: recurrent positive emotions; negative emotions as an affective component of well-being that are rare; cognitive assessment or «global judgment» of life satisfaction. Joy is the emotional side of happiness, and pleasure is the cognitive side of happiness. The happiness factors are simultaneously sources, conditions and areas of satisfaction with life, and at times personal characteristics of a person. In order to feel happiness, it is necessary to observe two ways of self-regulation of its motivation for the world: a personal increase in the significance of people and an increase in their own capabilities. Along with the term «happiness» other terms are used as well, such as «subjective well-being» and «cheerfulness». «Subjective well-being» consists of psychological, physical and social well-being. Although they have similarities, such terms are not identical and quite independent. Happiness is a sharp and intense sensation; from the point of view of expression other terms are weaker. The most transitory is a feeling of happiness. The longer is the psychological well-being, the longer is the pleasure of life. The authors analyze the psychological, physical and social components of subjective well-being, and the article also defines the external (objective) and internal (subjective) factors of happiness. They distinguish between external (health, income, work, social status, education, age, gender, religion, leisure), internal (neuroticism, extra-version, joy, love) and subjective (assessment of the subject in accor-dance with his life settings) determinants of happiness. Human happiness lies precisely in a peculiar combination of these factors.","Happiness consists of interconnected components: recurrent positive emotions, rare negative emotions, and a cognitive assessment of life satisfaction.",question,2065,150.0
7307,does microbiome affect leukemia,The Microbiome in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Simple Summary The role of the microbiome for the development and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not well understood. The immune system and microbiota closely interact and perturbations have strong implications for ALL development and course of the treatment. Significant differences in the microbiome with reduced diversity have been observed already at the onset of disease and have potential implications for leukemogenesis. Furthermore, the regular chemotherapeutic treatment regimen severely perturbs the microbiome, being associated with severe side effects such as mucositis, systemic inflammation, or infections. Herein, we review the latest microbiome studies in pediatric ALL patients, as well as provide an overview of current and future options to modulate the microbiome to improve the treatment’s outcome or even prevent leukemia development. Abstract For almost 30 years, the term “holobiont” has referred to an ecological unit where a host (e.g., human) and all species living in or around it are considered together. The concept highlights the complex interactions between the host and the other species, which, if disturbed may lead to disease and premature aging. Specifically, the impact of microbiome alterations on the etiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children is not fully understood, but has been the focus of much research in recent years. In ALL patients, significant reductions in microbiome diversity are already observable at disease onset. It remains unclear whether such alterations at diagnosis are etiologically linked with leukemogenesis or simply due to immunological alteration preceding ALL onset. Regardless, all chemotherapeutic treatment regimens severely affect the microbiome, accompanied by severe side effects, including mucositis, systemic inflammation, and infection. In particular, dominance of Enterococcaceae is predictive of infections during chemotherapy. Long-term dysbiosis, like depletion of Faecalibacterium, has been observed in ALL survivors. Modulation of the microbiome (e.g., by fecal microbiota transplant, probiotics, or prebiotics) is currently being researched for potential protective effects. Herein, we review the latest microbiome studies in pediatric ALL patients.","Reduced microbiome diversity is observed at the onset of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but its role in leukemogenesis remains unclear.",question,2270,144.0
9440,what is guide rna?,MultiGuideScan: a multi-processing tool for designing CRISPR guide RNA libraries,"SUMMARY
The recent advance in genome engineering technologies based on CRISPR/Cas9 system is enabling people to systematically understand genomic functions. A short RNA string (the CRISPR guide RNA) can guide the Cas9 endonuclease to specific locations in complex genomes to cut DNA double-strands. The CRISPR guide RNA is essential for gene editing systems. Recently, the GuideScan software is developed to design CRISPR guide RNA libraries, which can be used for genome editing of coding and noncoding genomic regions effectively. However, GuideScan is a serial program and computationally expensive for designing CRISPR guide RNA libraries from large genomes. Here, we present an efficient guide RNA library designing tool (MultiGuideScan) by implementing multiple processes of GuideScan. MultiGuideScan speeds up the guide RNA library designing about 9-12 times on a 32-process mode comparing to GuideScan. MultiGuideScan makes it possible to design guide RNA libraries from large genomes.

It increases the efficiency of the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, reduces calcium losses in urine, and mobilizes calcium stored in the skeleton. However, vitamin D receptors are present ubiquitously in the human body and indeed, vitamin D has a plethora of non-calcemic functions. In contrast to most vitamins, sufficient vitamin D can be synthesized in human skin. However, its production can be markedly decreased due to factors such as clothing, sunscreens, intentional avoidance of the direct sunlight, or the high latitude of the residence. Indeed, more than one billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient, and the deficiency is frequently undiagnosed. The chronic deficiency is not only associated with rickets/osteomalacia/osteoporosis but it is also linked to a higher risk of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or cancer. Supplementation of vitamin D may be hence beneficial, but the intake of vitamin D should be under the supervision of health professionals because overdosing leads to intoxication with severe health consequences.

15246,is human nature violent?,On Being Human(e),"A frequent and ironic sentiment we encounter is that violence cannot be prevented because “after all, it’s human nature to be violent.” While yes, on face value one can accept that we are “just” animals. Taking a philosophical and scientific approach to this, one can ask “what makes us unique?” We are, after all, just one of approximately 5000 living members of the mammal class of animal. Mammals are subject to their evolutionarily-honed genetic drives for survival, as are all living organisms. These drives can be perceived as violent and callous and are manifest through the use of available physical tools (e.g. tooth and claw) to survive and reproduce in a challenging environment. Unique to humans, however, is the extent to which we can use the brain as our survival tool, affording the opportunity to adapt our environment to suit us rather than our adaptation to suit our environment. We use this brain tool to introspect, to understand our individual role in a larger community of thinkers, in order to mutually benefit and perpetuate our species. We can in essence, override our base instincts and drives, making conscious decisions to “do the right thing.” Therefore the irony is that, to be human is to be humane.","Humans are unique in using their brains as a survival tool, allowing them to override base instincts and make conscious decisions to be humane.",question,1230,143.0

22728,what dose the research says about diabetes and epigenetics?,Epigenetics in the perioperative period,"The perioperative period is characterized by profound changes in the body's homoeostatic processes. This review seeks to address whether epigenetic mechanisms may influence an individual's reaction to surgery and anaesthesia. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that epigenetic mechanisms can explain many facets of susceptibility to acute and chronic pain, making them potential therapeutic targets. Modern pain management is still based upon opiates, and both the developmental expression of opioid receptors and opioid‐induced hyperalgesia have been linked to epigenetic mechanisms. In general, opiates seem to increase global DNA methylation levels. This is in contrast to local anaesthetics, which have been ascribed a global demethylating effect. Even though no direct investigations have been carried out, the potential influence of epigenetics on the inflammatory response that follows surgery seems a promising area for research. There is a considerable body of evidence that supports the involvement of epigenetics in the complex process of wound healing. Epigenetics is an important emerging research topic in perioperative medicine, with a huge potential to positively influence patient outcome.","Epigenetic mechanisms can explain susceptibility to acute and chronic pain, making them potential therapeutic targets in the perioperative period.",question,1219,146.0
20376,what is the decay rate of dna,Quantification of Environmental DNA (eDNA) Shedding and Decay Rates for Three Marine Fish.,"Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) to identify macroorganisms and biodiversity has the potential to significantly augment spatial and temporal biological monitoring in aquatic ecosystems. Current monitoring methods relying on the physical identification of organisms can be time consuming, expensive, and invasive. Measuring eDNA shed from organisms provides detailed information on the presence and abundance of communities of organisms. However, little is known about eDNA shedding and decay in aquatic environments. In the present study, we designed novel Taqman qPCR assays for three ecologically and economically important marine fish-Engraulis mordax (Northern Anchovy), Sardinops sagax (Pacific Sardine), and Scomber japonicas (Pacific Chub Mackerel). We subsequently measured fish eDNA shedding and decay rates in seawater mesocosms. eDNA shedding rates ranged from 165 to 3368 pg of DNA per hour per gram of biomass. First-order decay rate constants ranged from 0.055 to 0.101 per hour. We also examined the size fractionation of eDNA and concluded eDNA is both intra- and extracellular. Finally, we derived a simple mass-balance model to estimate fish abundance from eDNA concentration. The mesocosm-derived shedding and decay rates inform the interpretation of eDNA concentrations measured in environmental samples and future use of eDNA as a monitoring tool.",eDNA decay rate constants for marine fish range from 0.055 to 0.101 per hour.,question,1372,77.0
22819,efficacy of medically supervised injecting rooms,The Narrative of Evaluations: Medically Supervised Injecting Centers,"Medically supervised injecting centers, or drug consumption rooms are officially sanctioned places where people can inject or smoke illegal drugs in hygienic conditions and under supervision. Their ostensible purposes are to protect the health of drug users and contain the nuisance potential of open drug markets. This article argues that the debates and arguments supporting the establishment and existence of medically supervised injecting centers follow four interweaving narratives. These narratives can be characterized as (1) Caring and humanitarian (2) Elimination of public nuisance (3) Governance of the drug-using subject (4) Neo-liberal, utilitarian, and bureaucratic. These narratives alternatively combine and oppose each other. This means that the analysis of the benefits and problems with such initiatives depends on the perspective of the actors involved and the claims made for their effectiveness.","Medically supervised injecting centers aim to protect drug users' health and contain the nuisance potential of open drug markets, with varying perspectives on their benefits and problems.",phrase,917,187.0

12595,accounting faculty’s perspective on the technology,More Accounting Theory or More Information Technology,"It has been said that accounting faculty should teach theory and let students figure out how to apply the theory in the real world. This argument assumes that students arrive with technology skills sufficient to serve as a base for their college and even their professional careers. This paper uses survey methods to analyze the technology skills of undergraduate accounting students to determine their technological strengths and weaknesses. With this information, it is possible to gain a more accurate undergraduate student technology profile. We find that a large fraction of students are not proficient in requisite technologies even after completing the majority of their undergraduate accounting course work. We believe this supports the argument that the accounting curriculum would benefit from an increase in technology training. The technologies students were most interested in learning were tax software, small business accounting, generalized audit software and spreadsheets.","Accounting students often lack proficiency in requisite technologies, suggesting that the curriculum would benefit from increased technology training.",phrase,989,150.0
844,can people's ability to concentrate change over time?,Ambient Intelligence Telework System to Enhance Concentration for Each Individual: Easy to Concentrate Based on Neuroticism,"In recent years, telework has enormously increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some people believe that teleworkers can concentrate the same as in-person office work, while others do not. Previous studies showed that the work environment necessary for concentration tends to differ depending on the worker's individual attributes. The goal of this study is to propose an Ambient Intelligence (AMI) telework system suited for each individual to enhance concentration. In this paper, we used two videos with different levels of diligence on a task to investigate what kind of environment makes it easier to concentrate, depending on the degree of neuroticism. Concentration was estimated using the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which is an oscillatory brain signal elicited by repetitive auditory stimulation and used as a hearing test for infants and children. The changes in the power spectral density of the ASSR with concentration were increased by comparing EEG at rest and during concentration. The effect of the two types of videos on concentration was investigated by evaluating the relationship between neuroticism scores and the power spectral density of the ASSR. The results showed that there was a significant difference in concentration influenced by the two types of videos between the high and low neuroticism score groups. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the neuroticism score and the concentration influenced by the two types of videos. We found that people with lower neuroticism tended to easy to concentrate on their work after seeing someone working hard whereas people with higher neuroticism tended to easy to concentrate on their work after seeing someone working lazily. The experimental results suggest the possibility of constructing an AMI system suited to each individual that enhances concentration.","Concentration can be influenced by individual factors such as neuroticism, with different environments affecting people's ability to concentrate differently.",question,1874,157.0
15935,How if inflation affected by forgein trade?,On high inflation and the allocation of resources,"Abstract This paper formalizes some of the disruptive effects of inflation on the organization of markets. Rapid inflation induces buyers to speed up purchases, which thus inhibits the selection of more adequate trading partners through search. This blurs distinctions across firms of different productivities and leads to resource misallocations. As inflation causes efficient and inefficient firms to be less distinguishable, the incentives to engage in cost reduction are dampened and lower growth results. The model could provide a rationale for the large number of bankruptcies and large turnover rates following successful inflation stabilization programs, like those of Israel, Bolivia and Argentina.","High inflation disrupts market organization, blurs distinctions between efficient and inefficient firms, and leads to resource misallocations and lower growth.",question,707,159.0

11373,what is idh2 mutation?,Quantitative detection of IDH2 mutation for minimal residual disease monitoring in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and its comparison with mutations in NPM1 gene,"Acquired mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes have been detected in various hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where the incidence has been reported to be 15% [1 – 6]. Th e IDH1 and IDH2 genes encode enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α -ketoglutarate ( α -KG). Somatic mutations cause their dysfunction and an accumulation of aberrant 2-hydroxygluterate (2-HG) product in cells [5]. Th e decreased supply of α -KG or increased accumulation of 2-HG (i.e. metabolic biomarker of mutant IDH1/2 enzyme activity) is considered to be a possible basis for the oncogenic properties of IDH mutants [7]. Mutations in the IDH2 gene exclusively aff ect hotspot regions c.G419 (p.R140) and/or c.G515 (p.R172), which both localize in exon 4. Th e most frequent mutation in patients with AML reported to date is heterozygous c.G419A (p.R140Q) [8,9]. The use of IDH2 mutations for the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is under investigation and still remains unclear [8,10,11]. Recently, using conventional sequencing, we have reported that IDH2 mutations are stable and associated with the course of AML [11]. However, the sensitivity of direct sequencing limits its use for MRD monitoring. Thus, we developed a novel realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assay that enables rapid and sensitive quantification of the IDH2 c.G419A (p.R140Q) mutation. Here, we report on the applicability of the newly developed method for MRD monitoring in patients with AML and then compare the results with those obtained from monitoring NPM1 mutations. We investigated 60 unique samples [43 bone marrow (BM) and 17 peripheral blood (PB), Figure 1(A)] at different time points of AML treatment of eight patients with AML harboring the IDH2 mutation c.G419A (p.R140Q) who were previously or currently being treated in our institution from 2008 to 2012. With the exception of a single patient (patient no. 7) who received palliative treatment using low-dose cytosine arabinoside, all patients received curative therapy, including standard induction (45 mg/m 2 daunorubicin for 3 days and 100 – 200 mg/m 2 cytosine arabinoside for 7 days) or a double induction with the same drug combination. Additional treatment consisted of two to three consolidation chemotherapies (mostly highdose 3 g/m 2 cytosine arabinoside BID on days 1, 3 and 5, or 100 – 200 mg/m 2 cytosine arabinoside for 5 days and 9 mg/m 2 mitoxantrone for 2 days). Four patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Within this cohort, 6/8 patients harbored a parallel NPM1 mutation (fi ve patients had mutation A and one had mutation B). Th e patient characteristics are summarized in Figure 1(A). All patients signed an informed consent before the samples were collected, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. PB (patient nos. 1, 4 and 7) and BM (patient nos. 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8) samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a total volume of 5 mL each. Samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, monthly during induction and consolidation, every 2 – 3 months during follow-up, and at the time of hematological relapse. Th e number of samples per patient ranged between three and 14 and the median follow-up was 13.0 months (range 4 – 25 months). Th e genomic DNA was extracted according to a previously published protocol [12]. Quantifi cation of the IDH2 c.G419A (p.R140Q) mutation was performed using DNA-based RQ-PCR with a specifi c set of primers and a locked nucleic acids (LNA) probe that was specifi c for the mutant allele.

21319,is caffeine effective at increasing performance?,Does Acute Caffeine Supplementation Improve Physical Performance in Female Team-Sport Athletes? Evidence from a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Introduction: Recent original research and meta-analyses suggest that acute caffeine supplementation improves exercise performance in team-sport athletes (TSA). Nonetheless, most of the studies testing the effects of caffeine on TSA included samples of male athletes, and there is no meta-analysis of the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine on female TSA. The aim of the present study was to synthesize the existing literature regarding the effect of caffeine supplementation on physical performance in adult female TSA. Methods: A search was performed in Pubmed/Medline, SPORTDiscus and Scopus. The search was performed from the inception of indexing until 1 September 2021. Crossover randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effects of oral caffeine intake on several aspects of performance in female TSA were selected. The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed for individual studies using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (PEDro) and the RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) was performed for several performance variables. Results: The search retrieved 18 articles that fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Overall, most of the studies were of excellent quality with a low risk of bias. The meta-analysis results showed that caffeine increased performance in specific team-sport skills (SMD: 0.384, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.077–0.691), countermovement jump (SMD: 0.208, CI: 0.079–0.337), total body impacts (SMD: 0.488; 95% CI: 0.050, 0.927) and handgrip strength (SMD: 0.395, CI: 0.126–0.665). No effects were found on the ratings of perceived exertion, squat jumps, agility, repeated sprint ability or agility tests performed after fatigue. Conclusions: The results of the meta-analysis revealed that acute caffeine intake was effective in increasing some aspects of team-sports performance in women athletes. Hence, caffeine could be considered as a supplementation strategy for female athletes competing in team sports.","Caffeine supplementation improves specific team-sport skills, countermovement jump, total body impacts, and handgrip strength in female team-sport athletes.",question,2026,156.0
18055,why does trombolytic therapy fail in stroke patients?,"Myocardial Infarction, Thrombolytic Therapy, and Stroke: A Community‐Based Study","Background: Thrombolytic therapy used in patients with acute myocardial infarction may increase the risk of stroke. Scant information is available from community‐based studies. Summary of Report: Among 5,635 consecutive patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction to hospitals in Seattle and surrounding suburban King County, Washington, 116 (2.1%) experienced strokes during hospitalization. Of these strokes, 82 (71%) were ischemic and 34 (29%) were hemorrhagic, defined by a patient's having had a computed tomographic scan of the head that showed blood. Thrombolytic therapy was given to 1,413 of these patients (25%) and was associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke but reduced risk of ischemic stroke. The relative risk of stroke with thrombolytic therapy was estimated using multiple logistic regression to adjust for potential confounding factors. The adjusted relative risk for hemorrhagic stroke was 3.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7‐8.0); for ischemic stroke, 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2‐0.9); and for overall stroke, 1.0 (95% CI, 0.6‐1.7). The adjusted risk for death from any cause following stroke was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.4‐6.4). Conclusions: Although thrombolytic therapy had little effect on the overall occurrence of stroke, thrombolytic therapy increased the risk of stroke death because more patients with hemorrhagic than ischemic strokes died during their hospitalization. The rates of hemorrhagic stroke with thrombolytic therapy reported in the present study are higher than those reported in clinical trials in which treatment is given to select patients under strict protocols.

9415,which are the effects of microplastic exposure in human health?,Characterization of microparticles derived from waste plastics and their bio‐interaction with human lung A549 cells,"Microplastics (MPs) represent a worldwide emerging relevant concern toward human and environmental health due to their intentional or unintentional release. Human exposure to MPs by inhalation is predicted to be among the most hazardous. MPs include both engineered, or primary MPs, and secondary MPs, materials obtained by fragmentation from any plastic good. The major part of the environmental MPs is constituted by the second ones that are irregular in size, shape and composition. These features make the study of the biological impact of heterogenous MPs of extremely high relevance to better estimate the real toxicological hazards of these materials on human and environmental organisms. The smallest fractions of plastic granules, relying on the micron‐sized scale, can be considered as the most abundant component of the environmental MPs, and for this reason, they are typically used to perform toxicity tests using in vitro systems representative of an inhalation exposure scenario. In the present work, MPs obtained from industrial treatment of waste plastics (wMPs < 50 μm) were investigated, and after the physico‐chemical characterization, the cytotoxic, inflammatory and genotoxic responses, as well as the modality of wMPs interactions with alveolar lung cells, were determined. Obtained results indicated that, at high concentrations (100 μg/ml) and prolonged exposure time (48 h), wMPs affect biological responses by inducing inflammation and genotoxicity, as a result of the cell–wMP interactions, also including the uptake of the smaller particles.",Exposure to microplastics can induce inflammation and genotoxicity in human lung cells at high concentrations (100 Î¼g/ml) and prolonged exposure time (48 hours).,question,1570,162.0

A post-hoc analysis of the STEP 4 trial was conducted to identify whether early weight loss is predictive of later weight loss with maintenance once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide 2.4 mg. Methods: STEP 4 was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 withdrawal trial (NCT03548987). Adults aged ≥18 years with either body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity or BMI ≥30 kg/m2, without type 2 diabetes, underwent a 20-week run-in period. Participants reaching the maintenance dose of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 20 (regardless of weight loss achieved) were randomized 2:1 to semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, as adjunct to lifestyle intervention, for an additional 48 weeks. Percent change in body weight from week 0 to 68 was estimated using a mixed model for repeated measurements analysis with treatment, week 20 responder status, and the interaction between treatment and week 20 responder status as factors, and baseline body weight as a covariate, all nested within visit (based on the trial product estimand [treatment effect assuming treatment adherence and without use of rescue intervention] for the on-treatment period). Participants were considered responders if they achieved ≥5% weight loss at week 20. Whether the week 20 response to semaglutide predicted the achievement of clinically-relevant weight loss (≥5%) by week 68 was also assessed. Results: In STEP 4, 902 participants initiated semaglutide at week 0, of whom 803 were randomized at week 20 (semaglutide: n=535, placebo: n=268; characteristics at week 0 for all randomized participants: mean age 46 years, body weight 107.2 kg, BMI 38.4 kg/m2; 79.0% female; 83.7% white). For the 88.0% of participants randomized to semaglutide and who were responders at week 20, mean body weight change from week 0 to 68 was -19.7%. For non-responders at week 20, mean body weight change was -6.4% with continued semaglutide vs -0.3% with switch to placebo. Of all participants randomized to semaglutide, 86.2% achieved a clinically-relevant weight loss (≥5%) at week 68. Being a responder at week 20 was highly predictive of achieving this outcome (positive predictive value: 96.4%), whereas being a non-responder at week 20 had limited predictive value (negative predictive value: 42.9%). Conclusion: In the STEP 4 trial, the vast majority of participants who were randomized to the maintenance dose of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 20 had lost ≥5% body weight by week 68, with most achieving this by week 20.

13854,impact of mobile phone use on family relationships,Mobility and Emotional Harmonization in Families,"Abstract Families and social relationships are of course highly important, so it is worthwhile to ask how they are being affected by omnipresent mobile communication. In this paper, I will examine how increasingly portable communication technology affects daily activities and social relationships, especially in terms of the relationship between children and parents. While much of my focus will be on practices in other parts of the world, many of these trends may be applicable to China. Prior studies have created a body of generally accepted views about this area, and often concluded that mobile phone use was leading to increased separation between young people and their parents. However, a body of recent research on current practices among older teens does not offer support of this view. Rather, in many cases, mobile phones seem to impede independence-seeking behavior of young people. Thus the proliferation of mobile phones may actually be delaying the psychological maturation of young people even while strengthening and prolonging the process of (two-way) parent-child socialization. The seeming paradox in these results is discussed in my talk, and a synthesis is advanced that seeks to explain the new situation of locational dispersion and familial acculturation under conditions of mobility. Specifically, the current practices go beyond the concept of “hypercoordination” (proposed by Ling in 1999) and can be described as “emotional harmonization.”","Mobile phones may delay psychological maturation of young people while strengthening and prolonging parent-child socialization, leading to ""emotional harmonization.""",phrase,1471,165.0

Moreover, they bring with them and develop a range of skills that are crucial to the family and the community.

18607,is tap water safe?,Pharmaceuticals in Tap Water: Human Health Risk Assessment and Proposed Monitoring Framework in China,"Background: Pharmaceuticals are known to contaminate tap water worldwide, but the relevant human health risks have not been assessed in China. Objectives: We monitored 32 pharmaceuticals in Chinese tap water and evaluated the life-long human health risks of exposure in order to provide information for future prioritization and risk management. Methods: We analyzed samples (n = 113) from 13 cities and compared detected concentrations with existing or newly-derived safety levels for assessing risk quotients (RQs) at different life stages, excluding the prenatal stage. Results: We detected 17 pharmaceuticals in 89% of samples, with most detectable concentrations (92%) at < 50 ng/L. Caffeine (median–maximum, nanograms per liter: 24.4–564), metronidazole (1.8–19.3), salicylic acid (16.6–41.2), clofibric acid (1.2–3.3), carbamazepine (1.3–6.7), and dimetridazole (6.9–14.7) were found in ≥ 20% of samples. Cities within the Yangtze River region and Guangzhou were regarded as contamination hot spots because of elevated levels and frequent positive detections. Of the 17 pharmaceuticals detected, 13 showed very low risk levels, but 4 (i.e., dimetridazole, thiamphenicol, sulfamethazine, and clarithromycin) were found to have at least one life-stage RQ ≥ 0.01, especially for the infant and child life stages, and should be considered of high priority for management. We propose an indicator-based monitoring framework for providing information for source identification, water treatment effectiveness, and water safety management in China. Conclusion: Chinese tap water is an additional route of human exposure to pharmaceuticals, particularly for dimetridazole, although the risk to human health is low based on current toxicity data. Pharmaceutical detection and application of the proposed monitoring framework can be used for water source protection and risk management in China and elsewhere.","Chinese tap water contains pharmaceuticals like dimetridazole, but the risk to human health is low based on current toxicity data.",question,1905,130.0
1843,is scoliosis surgery effective,Long-term Results of Conservative Therapy of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Using the Cheneau Brace,"Abstract Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a disease of the growing skeleton. The goal in therapy is to decelerate or to prevent progression of the spinal curve. As part of a retrospective study the patient group of the scoliosis surgery from 1995–2016 was analysed according to the inclusion criteria of the Scoliosis research Society (SRS). 159 of 643 of the patients fullfilled the specific criteria. The assessment of effectiveness was based on the progression of the angle of curvature. If it was ≤5° it was judged positively. The therapy in accordance to Cheneau is a full-time bracing orthosis. Data from 159 patients – 136 fem. (85.5%), 23 male (14.5%) was analysed. The average age at the beginning of treatment was 13.3±1.7 years. The average duration was 3.47±1.2 years. The average Cobb-angle before treatment was 28.39°±9.44°. At the completion is was 27.7°±12.34°. Stabilisation of scoliosis (≤5°) was achieved for 136 of the patients (85.5%). The final follow-up showed a progression of the Cobb angel>5° in 23 cases, of which 19 had to undergo secondary surgery. The length of therapy had a positive influence (p=0.057) on the result. Brace treatment constitutes an effective method of therapy at curvatures between 20–40°. Short duration of therapy correlates with a expressively increased risk towards progression (p=0.057). The Cheneau brace treatment constitutes an effective treatment at curvature angles between 20–40°. The risk of progression can be reduced by a timely and correct identification.","Cheneau brace treatment is effective for scoliosis with curvature angles between 20-40°, stabilizing scoliosis (≤5°) in 85.5% of patients.",question,1521,138.0
13458,what does research says about morphological quenching in astronomy,"The quenching of galaxies, bulges, and disks since cosmic noon. A machine learning approach for identifying causality in astronomical data","We present an analysis of the quenching of star formation in galaxies, bulges, and disks throughout the bulk of cosmic history, from z = 2 − 0. We utilise observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey at low redshifts. We complement these data with observations from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey at high redshifts. Additionally, we compare the observations to detailed predictions from the LGalaxies semi-analytic model. To analyse the data, we developed a machine learning approach utilising a Random Forest classiﬁer. We ﬁrst demonstrate that this technique is extremely e ﬀ ective at extracting causal insight from highly complex and inter-correlated model data, before applying it to various observational surveys. Our primary observational results are as follows: at all redshifts studied in this work, we ﬁnd bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching, out of the photometric parameter set (incorporating bulge mass, disk mass, total stellar mass, and B / T structure). Moreover, we also ﬁnd bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching in both bulge and disk structures, treated separately. Hence, intrinsic galaxy quenching must be due to a stable mechanism operating over cosmic time, and the same quenching mechanism must be e ﬀ ective in both bulge and disk regions. Despite the success of bulge mass in predicting quenching, we ﬁnd that central velocity dispersion is even more predictive (when available in spectroscopic data sets). In comparison to the LGalaxies model, we ﬁnd that all of these observational results may be consistently explained through quenching via preventative ‘radio-mode’ active galactic nucleus feedback. Furthermore, many alternative quenching mechanisms (including virial shocks, supernova feedback, and morphological stabilisation) are found to be inconsistent with our observational results and those from the literature. are known mathematically to be causal or a causal for quenching. For the full parameter set, it is absolutely clear that M BH is ultimately the most important parameter, and essentially no importance is given to any other parameter (except at a very low level with M H at low redshifts). This is expected in the model since LGalaxies quenches centrals exclusively through preventative AGN feedback. Hence, our RF classiﬁer correctly extracts the causation in the LGalaxies model. In the absence of M BH and M H , bulge mass is clearly found to be the most important parameter governing quenching at both redshifts, which may be interpreted as a key prediction of the model in the a causal bulge–disk parameter space.",Bulge mass is the most predictive parameter of quenching in both bulge and disk structures.,question,2718,91.0
10019,what is encoding in psychology,Interpreting encoding and decoding models,"Encoding and decoding models are widely used in systems, cognitive, and computational neuroscience to make sense of brain-activity data. However, the interpretation of their results requires care. Decoding models can help reveal whether particular information is present in a brain region in a format the decoder can exploit. Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about representational spaces. In the context of sensory experiments, where stimuli are experimentally controlled, encoding models enable us to test and compare brain-computational theories. Encoding and decoding models typically include fitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the contribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a decoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a decoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor variables or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are evaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct interpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to new response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same population, or to stimuli from a different population). Significant decoding or encoding performance of a single model (at whatever level of generality) does not provide strong constraints for theory. Many models must be tested and inferentially compared for analyses to drive theoretical progress.",Encoding models in psychology make comprehensive predictions about representational spaces and help test and compare brain-computational theories.,question,1652,146.0
4643,is there a relationship between psychosis and cannabis use??,The link between cannabis use and psychosis: furthering the debate,"The issue of whether an association exists between cannabis and psychosis exists, and why, has received considerable attention in recent years (Hall, 1998; Mueser et al. 1998; Blanchard et al. 2000; Degenhardt & Hall, 2002). There are probably a number of reasons for the sustained interest. First, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are often chronic or recurring (Mason et al. 1996), are associated with significant disability (Keith et al. 1991) and they place a considerable burden upon the community at large (Hall et al. 1985; Knapp, 1997). Secondly, over the past few decades, high rates of cannabis use and use disorders have been observed among persons with schizophrenia and other psychoses (Barbee et al. 1989; Fowler et al. 1998), suggesting the possibility that cannabis use may be causally related to psychotic disorders. Thirdly, given what is known about the psychotomimetic effects of cannabis (Hall et al. 2001), it is plausible that high doses of cannabis may produce psychotic symptoms. Finally, clinical research with persons with psychotic disorders has found that problematical substance use is correlated with a range of negative outcomes including relapse, rehospitalization, poor medication compliance, poorer social functioning and increased treatment costs (Salyers & Mueser, 2001), suggesting drug use may be related to worsened clinical outcomes.","Cannabis use may be linked to psychotic disorders, as high doses may produce psychotic symptoms.",question,1383,96.0
13936,can humans be divided into biological races?,Race and ethnicity as biological constructs.,"For some time, biologists and anthropologists have overwhelmingly rejected the partitioning of modern humans into biological ""races."" An examination of recent human evolutionary history suggests that the zoological definition of race, based on significant genetic differences, cannot be legitimately applied to contemporary humans. Extensive past hybridization, plasticity of the human phenotype, the presence of ecotypes, the lack of extensive molecular information, and the lack of longitudinal multigenerational evaluations of diverse groups contribute to ambiguity in taxonomic assignment. Although biological aggregates do exist, they represent variation below the subspecies level, and, as such, are much more tenuous over evolutionary time. The persistent reference to quasibiological constructs such as ethnicity and race in the lay and scientific literatures requires that ethnicity be scrutinized for possible biological dimensions. The Diop model of ethnicity suggests that at least three components contribute to its formation: a historical factor, a linguistic factor, and a psychological factor, each of which can be examined for possible biological dimensions. Presumed biological affinities may allow certain groups to expand and extend their collective history and amplify their kin networks, possibly improving group biological fitness. Individual and group initial language of acquisition may influence brain physiology and organize the template for interpretation and behavior, creating greater consistency of response across otherwise divergent biological aggregates. Psychological continuity in particular behavioral traits, particularly repetitive multigenerational responses, may have an adaptive aspect at the group level. While ethnicity remains primarily a sociocultural category, it has biological precursors, parameters, and consequences for both individuals and groups. The genetic components of these biological dimensions remain to be identified and quantified.","Modern humans cannot be legitimately partitioned into biological ""races"" due to factors like extensive past hybridization and the lack of significant genetic differences.",question,1993,170.0

Biological systems are arranged hierarchically, with smaller units forming the components of larger systems. The evolutionary hierarchy, based on replication of genetic information and reproduction, is a complex of genes/organisms/demes/species and higher taxa. The ecological hierarchy, based on patterns of matter–energy transfer, is a complex of proteins/organisms/avatars/local ecosystems/regional ecosystems. All organisms are simultaneously parts of both hierarchical systems. Darwin’s original formulation of natural selection maps smoothly onto a diagram where the two hierarchical systems are placed side-by-side. The “sloshing bucket” theory of evolution emerges from empirical cases in biological history mapped onto this dual hierarchy scheme: little phenotypically discernible evolution occurs with minor ecological disturbance; conversely, greatest concentrations of change in evolutionary history follow mass extinctions, themselves based on physical perturbations of global extent. Most evolution occurs in intermediate-level regional “turnovers,” when species extinction leads to rapid evolution of new species.

By turning upside down the letter-perfect and internalized global economic and social judgments and expectations, the Global Financial Crisis gave birth to a new world order and to a ‘new normal’. Since the internal dynamics of the firms, sectors, countries and regions differ highly, the effect of the global crisis to firms, sectors, countries and regions in terms of intensity of the shock and the recovery process was also uneven. This new normal, together with the technological development, increased the importance of the innovation and efficient use of scarce resources to avoid deadlock in the inclusive and sustainable growth. Thus, the aim of this study is to focus on the innovation efficiency of the countries to see the effect of the global crisis on the capabilities of the countries. In this study, two alternative models with two different approaches of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under two different specifications (input-oriented and output-oriented) are utilized to trace innovation performance across 56 countries during the global crisis from 2007 to 2012. The empirical evidence reveals that the negative effects of 2008 crisis are reflected on innovation efficiencies of countries in 2008 in the base model and 2009 in the lag model. In addition, grouping countries according to their GDP and GDP per capita and implementing two different models show that there could be difference in the innovation efficiency results since the DEA model shows the innovation efficiency in comparison with the other countries’ efficiency.

The aim of the present study was to investigate short‐ and long‐term consequences of neurotoxic METH doses on mice behaviors. Male BALB/c mice, 12–14 weeks old, were injected with dl‐METH (i.p., 7.5 mg/kg x 4 times, every 2 hours) or saline. Behaviors were accessed at 10 days after drug treatment. METH administration caused significant decreases in responding to object displacement using an Open Field Object Recognition test. In contrast, METH caused increased response to object novelty. There were no drug‐induced effects on locomotor activity. Moreover, repeated METH injections resulted in significant decreases in dopamine (DA) levels in the STR, frontal cortex (FC) and olfactory bulb (OB) in mice sacrificed 10 days after drug treatment. Furthermore, as previously reported for the cortex and striatum, METH administration caused marked increases in the number of cells that were positive for TUNEL staining in the OB at 3 days, observations that are indicative of drug‐induced enhancement of cell death in that structure.

In the present study, we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of MSM in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. MSM significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) by alleviating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were decreased by MSM treatment in cell culture supernatants. Further study indicated that the translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB to the nucleus was inhibited by MSM treatment in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, in which it helped block degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that topical administration of MSM at 500-1250 microg/ear resulted in similar inhibitory activities in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced mouse ear edema.

In this study it was investigated whether vacation modified the effects of occupational and domestic stress on different aspects of well-being. Also, the moderating effect of recuperation was studied. Occupational stress, operationalized as perceived workload, domestic stress and well-being were measured by questionnaire ten days before and three days after a two-week vacation from work for a sample of n = 53 employees of a hardware company. Workload did not affect well-being before vacation, but had a deteriorating impact on the quality of sleep, social activities, and mood after vacation. Domestic stress had a similar impact on well-being before and after vacation. Subjects reporting greater recuperation during vacation had less physical complaints and greater life satisfaction when experiencing high workload than subjects reporting less recuperation. In conclusion, this study shows that vacation generally does not buffer the effects of occupational or domestic stress on well-being. Rather, the results suggest that high levels of postvacation work-load eliminate the potentially positive effect of vacation. However, the results also indicate that a restful vacation may buffer postvacation work-related stress with respect to physical complaints and life satisfaction, but not with respect to mood-related aspects of well-being and sleep.","Vacation generally does not buffer the effects of stress on well-being, but a restful vacation may help with physical complaints and life satisfaction.",question,1460,151.0
15743,is mdma safe for consumption?,"[Ecstasy--the status in French-speaking Switzerland. Composition of seized drugs, analysis of biological specimens and short review of its pharmacological action and toxicity].","Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") and other related phenylethylamines are nowadays used extensively in Western Switzerland at dance clubs and raves. There is a widely held belief among teenagers and misusers that ecstasy is safe. In the last years however, an increasing number of reports of MDMA-related deaths has been reported. Acute clinical toxicity problems following MDMA ingestion include hyperthermia, convulsions and arrhythmias. There is also growing concern that these phenylethylamines are neurotoxic and cause long-term damage to serotonineric nerve terminals in animal brains. Qualitative analyses by GC-MS of street samples of ecstasy showed that only a part of them contain MDMA or related phenylethylamines (MDA, MDEA, MBDB and 2C-B). Most of them were mixed with caffeine and an excipient (sugars or polyols [e.g. mannitol]). Amphetamine cut with caffeine and other drugs (e.g. testosterone), stimulants (e.g. pseudoephedrine) and other drugs unrelated to stimulants and phenylethylamines (e.g. LSD, chloroquine, vasodilators) were also detected. Quantitative determinations performed by HPLC-DAD or EC-DAD reveal huge fluctuations in the amount of active substance(s) per tablet. MDMA and related compounds display unique psychoactive properties, acting as a stimulant and inducing feelings of empathy. The effects of MDMA intake are very likely the results of the large release of serotonin (5-HT) in the synaptic cleft, of the inhibition of the re-uptake inactivation of 5-HT and of the inhibition of a key-enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of 5-HT. Forensic investigations performed at our institute showed significant blood levels of MDMA, MDEA and MDA in samples drawn from people suspected of driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs. Up to now, no death could be attributed to MDMA intoxication only because our analyses always revealed the additional presence of toxic amounts of other psychoactive drugs (e.g. opiates, cocaine). Our study shows that because of the variable composition of ecstasy tablets, unpredictable types and amounts of drugs may be taken by MDMA misusers. Moreover, there is considerable concern that traffic accidents may be caused by MDMA-abusers.

Sea turtles are primarily visual predators, with the ability to discriminate according to colour and shape; therefore these factors play a role in feeding choices. Classification methodologies of ingested plastic currently do not record these variables, however here, refined protocols allow us to test the hypothesis that plastic is selectively ingested when it resembles the food items of green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Turtles in the eastern Mediterranean displayed strong diet-related selectivity towards certain types (sheet and threadlike), colours (black, clear and green) and shapes (linear items strongly preferred) of plastic when compared to the environmental baseline of plastic beach debris. There was a significant negative relationship between size of turtle (curved carapace length) and number/mass of plastic pieces ingested, which may be explained through naivety and/or ontogenetic shifts in diet.

Aims To investigate the long-term effect of CBT on Hypochondriacal Disorder using several mental health measures. Follow-up time was at least 10 years. Method A total of 50 patients with a long history of Hypochondriacal Disorder, diagnosed according to ICD-10, received 16 sessions of individual CBT and were followed up with an uncontrolled design. All participants were assessed before and after the intervention period, and 10 years later. Intention-to-treat mixed-model repeated-measures analysis were conducted. The study has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00959452. Results Patients displayed significant improvements across all outcomes, including level of health anxiety, somatisation, symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life, somatisation at treatment completion. Treatment gains were well maintained 10 years later. Conclusions This uncontrolled treatment study suggests that patients treated with CBT for Hypochondriacal Disorder have significantly reduced health anxiety 1 year after treatment completion and the results are maintained 10 years later. The results indicate that CBT has a lasting effect, but the lack of a control group and use of only one therapist, means that care should be taken when generalising the findings.","CBT has a lasting effect in reducing health anxiety for patients with Hypochondriacal Disorder, with results maintained 10 years later.",question,1429,135.0

Pre-K programmes differ in whether they are universal (i.e. available to all children) or targeted (i.e. offered only to children with specific risk factors). Due to the lack of empirical evidence on differences in programme types, we conducted comparisons using data from an 11-state pre-K evaluation study. Universal and targeted programmes were compared on classroom characteristics and gains in achievement for low-income children. Findings indicated that while two aspects of classroom structural quality (hours per day and teacher education) were higher for universal programmes, classroom process quality was higher for targeted programmes.

Occasional cases of intra-articular lipoma arborescens have been re ported5-11; however, true intra-articular lipoma is extremely rare3,4. These two entities have been con sidered as one in some recent reports12-14, but true lipoma and lipoma arbores cens are different pathological entities3,4, with different clinical presentation and pathogenesis. Stressing the differences between true lipoma and lipoma arborescens, we describe the case of a patient who had a large intra-articular lipoma and no joint symptoms.

A seventy-three-year-old woman who had been previously healthy was admitted to our hospital because of a soft-tissue mass involving the right knee joint. She had first noted the mass ten years earlier, when it appeared to be much smaller. Because she had no pain or limitation of activities, she had not sought medical attention. Upon discovering the mass, the patient's local physician referred her to us in September 1999. The medical history and the family history were unremarkable, and the patient remembered no trauma to the knee.

Physical examination revealed a soft-tissue mass measuring 6 by 9 cm on the anteromedial aspect of the right knee joint (Fig. 1Fig. 1). On palpation, the mass was found to be adherent to the joint, soft, nontender, and similar in temperature to the surrounding tissue. The mass became more prominent and firm with contraction of the quadriceps muscle. No joint effusion was present. Full extension and 140 degrees of flexion of the knee were possible, without pain or locking. No muscle atrophy was evident. The results of blood tests, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein level, were essentially normal.

21887,why healthy behaviors tend to cluster?,Health lifestyle patterns of U.S. adults.,"BACKGROUND
Reaching national health objectives depends upon our ability to encourage the performance of multiple good health behaviors. There are cognitive, social, and biological reasons for expecting health behaviors to cluster. However, few studies have found significant associations among health behaviors, with the exception of the documented link between smoking and alcohol consumption.


METHODS
We used cluster analysis to identify population subgroups with similar patterns of diet quality, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. This is the first study of health behavior interrelationships to include a measure of overall diet quality and a large sample from a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults.


RESULTS
We identified seven health behavior typologies: 10% of the sample (health promoting lifestyle) had an overall healthy lifestyle, 25% had a good diet but sedentary activity level, 18% had fair diet but high activity level (fitness lifestyle). Individuals in the passive lifestyle cluster (25%) had no active health promoting activities but did avoid risk taking health behaviors. Six percent of the sample were in a drinking cluster, 15% in a smoking cluster, and 2% had a hedonic lifestyle characterized by heavy drinking and smoking. These lifestyle clusters could be characterized by demographic and socioeconomic factors.


CONCLUSIONS
This research indicates that it is possible to identify a discrete number of health lifestyles in a population sample of U.S. adults. Understanding past, present, and changing health lifestyles may provide insights for health behavior research and information for the development and targeting of public health programs that can impact on multifactorial chronic diseases.","There are cognitive, social, and biological reasons for expecting health behaviors to cluster and it is possible to identify a discrete number of health lifestyles in a population sample of U.S. adults",question,1767,201.0

Gene editing may prevent or cure a disease by inducing genetic changes at endogenous loci. Genome editing includes not only the insertion, deletion or replacement of nucleotides, but also the modulation of gene expression and epigenetic editing. Emerging technologies based on ZFs, TALEs, and CRISPR/Cas systems have extended the boundaries of genome manipulation and promoted genome editing approaches to the level of promising strategies for counteracting genetic diseases. The parallel development of efficient delivery systems has also increased our access to the CNS.

18668,what are the factors that influence the issuance of sukuk?,Charting Future Resilient Sukuk Market in Malaysia: What can be Learned from Macreconomic Determinants of Sukuk Issuance?,"This article examines the effects of macroeconomic variables on sukuk issuance in Malaysia from the first quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2019. It seeks to analyse the relationship between Sukuk issuance and selected macroeconomic variables such as Bursa Malaysia composite index (BMCI), exchange rate (EXR), GDP, Inflation (INF) and interest rate (INT). This study employs time series analysis techniques such as Johansen Co-Integration Analysis, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) analysis to unravel the short run and the long run dynamics among the selected variables. Our findings suggest that BMCI, EXR, INT are significant in affecting sukuk issuance in Malaysia in the long run while for the short run, the BMCI, EXR, and GDP, are significant.  EXR is the most important contributor in short-term for sukuk issuance, followed by GDP and BMCI. These findings further suggest that the government can closely monitor exchange rate (EXR) movement to promote fundings of business projects through sukuk issuance. The findings on the significance of BMCI in both the short run and the long run suggest that investors can also consider investing in sukuk securities within their portfolio investment to manage the risk and return profile. It is also recommended that policy makers can design policies to ensure the performance of BMCI and GDP growth to achieve a resilient sukuk market especially during and post the Covid-19 pandemic.","Factors influencing sukuk issuance in Malaysia include Bursa Malaysia composite index (BMCI), exchange rate (EXR), interest rate (INT), and GDP.",question,1497,144.0

Day and night, 10 h long each, filter-based aerosol samples were collected for 4 months (November 2009 to February 2010) throughout the winter season. These samples were subjected to gravimetric and quantitative chemical analyses for determining water-soluble ions (NH4+, F−, Cl−, NO3−, and SO42−) using an ion chromatograph and trace elements using an inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer. The mean PM1 mass concentrations were recorded as 114 ± 71 μg/m3 (day) and 143 ± 86 μg/m3 (night), respectively.

9566,Does financial stress lead to bad decision making?,The impact of threat of shock on the framing effect and temporal discounting: executive functions unperturbed by acute stress?,"Anxiety and stress-related disorders constitute a large global health burden, but are still poorly understood. Prior work has demonstrated clear impacts of stress upon basic cognitive function: biasing attention toward unexpected and potentially threatening information and instantiating a negative affective bias. However, the impact that these changes have on higher-order, executive, decision-making processes is unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of a translational within-subjects stress induction (threat of unpredictable shock) on two well-established executive decision-making biases: the framing effect (N = 83), and temporal discounting (N = 36). In both studies, we demonstrate (a) clear subjective effects of stress, and (b) clear executive decision-making biases but (c) no impact of stress on these decision-making biases. Indeed, Bayes factor analyses confirmed substantial preference for decision-making models that did not include stress. We posit that while stress may induce subjective mood change and alter low-level perceptual and action processes (Robinson et al., 2013c), some higher-level executive processes remain unperturbed by these impacts. As such, although stress can induce a transient affective biases and altered mood, these need not result in poor financial decision-making.","Stress may induce subjective mood change and alter low-level processes, but some higher-level executive processes, like financial decision-making, remain unperturbed by these impacts.",question,1321,183.0

Evidence of anti-islet cell autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes appears in the first years of life; however, little is known regarding the establishment of the gut microbiome in early infancy. Here, we sought to determine whether differences were present in early composition of the gut microbiome in children in whom anti-islet cell autoimmunity developed. We investigated the microbiome of 298 stool samples prospectively taken up to age 3 years from 22 case children in whom anti-islet cell autoantibodies developed, and 22 matched control children who remained islet cell autoantibody–negative in follow-up. The microbiome changed markedly during the first year of life, and was further affected by breast-feeding, food introduction, and birth delivery mode. No differences between anti-islet cell autoantibody–positive and –negative children were found in bacterial diversity, microbial composition, or single-genus abundances. However, substantial alterations in microbial interaction networks were observed at age 0.5 and 2 years in the children in whom anti-islet cell autoantibodies developed. The findings underscore a role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of anti-islet cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes.","The gut microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of anti-islet cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes, with altered microbial interaction networks observed in affected children.",question,1336,179.0
21077,effect of socioeconomic status on meat consumption,"Food, Classed? Social Inequality and Diet: Understanding Stratified Meat Consumption Patterns in Germany","Based on a complementary mixed-methods design, the dissertation sheds light on the relationship between meat consumption practices and consumers’ socioeconomic position. 
In a first step, two large-scale data sets, the German Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe (EVS) 2013 and the Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) 2016, are used to establish empirical relationships between meat consumption practices and consumers’ socioeconomic position. Education and income do not show the same effects across social groups. Income most strongly affects the meat consumption patterns of low-income consumers, and income effects diminish as income increases. Furthermore, income does not make much of a difference for consumers with low levels of education. Meat-reduced and meat-free diets are also more common among students and among self-employed persons, even after controlling for income and education. Income does not necessarily influence the amount of meat that is consumed but the type and the price of the purchased meat. 
In a second step, data from 46 semi-structured interviews with non-vegetarian and vegetarian consumers is used to gain a profound understanding of the mechanisms behind these statistical relationships. Differences in consumption patterns do not result from differences in food ideals, but from different capacities for implementing dietary changes. These capacities are significantly shaped by material and non-material resources. I argue that 1) reducing consumption does not require financial resources, but voluntary meat reduction is significantly linked to financial resources in different ways; 2) university education is conducive to meat reduction as it fosters scientism and the ability to quickly gather and exploit new sources of information; 3) high-SES consumers value self-improvement and uniqueness which encourages dietary changes and aids in dealing with social conflict arising from such changes; 4) food neophilia is an important precondition for the adoption and maintenance of meat-reduced diets, and income and education foster food neophilia; 5) familiar foods are an important compensatory tool that offsets negative emotions arising from material scarcity, stress, and social conflict. 
In the last part, I show that all interviewees categorize, evaluate and judge others’ food and meat consumption practices, and that these judgments have a series of intended and unintended consequences. The main findings, implications and limitations of this study, as well as avenues for future research are discussed.","Income most strongly affects meat consumption patterns of low-income consumers, with meat-reduced and meat-free diets more common among students and self-employed persons.",phrase,2547,171.0
11214,what leads to long covid?,Measures for preventing nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2 in hematology departments,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread all over theworld and has resulted in 1,436,198 confirmed cases of infection and 85,522 deaths as of 9 April 2020 [2]. This condition poses an urgent public health issue in the world [3]. No specific treatment or vaccine is available against this virus [4]. Hence, a classic but effective method to stop the propagation is by cutting the spread chain by using personal protective equipment and limiting personal contact [5]. The incubation period of COVID-19 is 1–14 days, mostly 3–7 days, and its main manifestations include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. COVID-19 is transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets and close contact [6, 7]. Fragile patients such as patients with cancer and elderly persons comprise the frequently infected population with severe symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or hypoxemia, 1 week after the onset of the disease, and the prognosis is very poor [8]. Hence, more attention should be paid in coping with patients having blood diseases. Moreover, these patients usually develop infection other than COVID-19 with manifestation of fever because of immunodeficiency and/or myelosuppression after many cycles of chemotherapy [9]. COVID-19 infection should be distinguished from other microbiological infections for patients in hematology. Considering the COVID-19 exacerbation, the consequences are extremely serious for these fragile patients. Hence, potentially infected patients with COVID-19 should be identified quickly and isolated early [10]. Furthermore, health personnel should be protected from infection to provide the best possible medical services for patients and evaluate the outbreak risk in hospital [11]. Therefore, the prevention and control strategies for nosocomial infection in the hematology department should be discussed to prevent COVID-19 infection and severe consequences.

Objective To explore differences in the Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 (FMQ-10; Azevedo et at. 2015), between sleep groups, in Portuguese pregnant women. Methods Four hundred and nineteen pregnant women (mean age: 32.51 ± 4.759; weeks of gestation: 17.32 ± 4.803) answered the Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 and the Insomnia Assessment Scale (IAS, Marques et al., 2015). Three sleep groups were created considering all the IAS items: good sleepers (no insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment); insomnia symptoms groups (one/more insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment; exclusion of other conditions/disorders explaining the symptoms); insomniacs (one/more insomnia symptoms; one/more daily associated impairment; exclusion of other conditions/disorders explaining the symptoms). Results There were significant differences in the total FMQ-10 score, the F1/Nonjudging of inner experience and the F2/acting with awareness, between sleep groups [respectively, F (2.402) = 6,933; P = 0.001; F (2.406) = 10.243; P = 0.001; F (2.406) = 37.431; P = 0.002].

16399,is drinking milk good for the heart,[The nutrients of the milk on cardiovascular health].,"The incidence of milk components on cardiovascular health is reviewed. A fraction of great interest in relation to cardiovascular disease is that of minerals, especially calcium. Benefits of milk in reducing blood pressure due to bioavailable calcium, along with other mineral elements present and bioactive peptides with antihypertensive ability, ACE inhibitors (key enzyme involved in the regulation of blood pressure) have been documented. Furthermore, a positive association of diets with high levels of calcium from milk, the fecal excretion of fat--which is favored by the same--and cardiovascular markers has also been reported. The presence in the milk of the essential, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic fatty acids, although at low levels, is particularly interesting. Moreover, in the milk fat bioactive components as conjugated linoleic acid and sphingomyelin, which could exert potential cardioprotective effects are also present. However, because it contains high levels of saturated fatty acids, milk fat products consumption has been discouraged indiscriminately.

12349,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Assessment techniques for curricular improvement: pre-conference workshop,"Professional and regional accreditation bodies increasingly require programs to maintain a three-part assess/evaluate/improve process. This three-part process must be clearly documented, regularly used, and should be inclusive of all faculty. Adhering to this process should enable a program to determine the extent to which students are achieving stated educational objectives and outcomes. In recent years program assessment has become more rigorous; it is no longer sufficient to collect data and evaluate outcomes once every accreditation cycle. Instead, assessment is now viewed as an ongoing activity that will serve to effect change and should lead to continuous improvement of the curriculum. Program evaluation should also include other key constituents such as alumni, students, and employers. Outcomes-based assessment presents a new set of challenges for departments to grapple with. It is sometimes difficult to identify the types of data to collect, and once collected, how to use the data to evaluate individual courses and the overall program. Moreover, it is challenging to interpret the data to identify specific strengths and weaknesses within the program. 
 
The workshop will begin with an overview of the current state of outcomes-based assessment, and will continue with an explanation of the terminology currently in use. A survey of effective data collection techniques will be presented, including direct and indirect assessment techniques. The presenters own assessment process will be presented and critiqued, and participants will have an opportunity to apply similar techniques for their own assessment and accreditation requirements. The goal of the workshop is to help participants understand how to collect, interpret, and use assessment data for the accreditation process to improve the quality of their courses and the overall degree program.

This study addresses the value of patients' reported symptoms as markers of tumor recurrence after definitive therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the correlation between patients' symptoms and objective findings in the diagnosis of local and/or regional recurrences of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in the first 2 years of follow-up.


DESIGN
Retrospective single-institution study of a prospectively collected database.


SETTING
Regional hospital.


PARTICIPANTS
We reviewed the clinical records of patients treated for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal carcinomas between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Correlation between symptoms and oncologic status (recurrence vs remission) in the posttreatment period.


RESULTS
Of the 101 patients included, 30 had recurrences. Pain, odynophagia, and dysphonia were independently correlated with recurrence (odds ratios, 16.07, 11.20, and 5.90, respectively; P < .001).

Among 345 patients, prevalence of 30-day, 12-month and lifetime MDD was 3.8% (95% CI 2.2%, 6.3%; n = 13), 10.7% (95% CI 7.9%, 14.4%; n = 37) and 22.9% (95% CI 18.8%, 27.6%; n = 79), respectively. Patients with 12-month MDD had more severe gastrointestinal track involvement than patients without 12-month MDD, but there were no other significant differences on socio-demographic or disease variables. Among patients with 12-month MDD, 81.1% (95% CI 65.8%, 90.3%) reported a prior depression episode compared with 3.9% (95% CI 2.2%, 6.7%) among patients without 12-month MDD (P < 0.01).


CONCLUSION
The prevalence of 30-day, 12-month and lifetime MDD among Canadian SSc patients is approximately twice that of the Canadian general population and somewhat higher than in arthritis. SSc patients face a range of psychosocial problems and may benefit from a broad supportive care approach.","The prevalence of 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD) among Canadian systemic sclerosis patients is 10.7%, which is approximately twice that of the Canadian general population.",question,1590,181.0
13391,the use of technology in the design of interior spaces for modern homes,Designing Future Ubiquitous Homes with OUI Interiors: Possibilities and Challenges,"As our living environments, homes should be expected to house objects with which we are comfortable. This applies equally to the technology we introduce to our domestic environments: it should be blended or embedded within them, or at least intuitive and unobtrusive in the space. In this paper, we survey a number of the latest Organic User Interfaces (OUIs) and discuss how these novel designs can be adopted to help build future domestic smart environments. In this sense, interior spaces, surfaces (walls, floors, tables and ceilings), and interior objects such as furniture and decorative accessories can become computationally-driven interactive artefacts, potentially changing their physical appearances, i.e., shape, colour, pattern or texture. We believe that Human-Building Interaction (HBI) will soon evolve to develop and employ OUIs in domestic environments, dynamically supporting our personal preferences and enhancing our living experiences. We propose some of the potential benefits of ‘OUI Interiors’ such as employing familiar intuitive interactions, supporting psychological and physiological wellbeing of inhabitants and the opportunity of designing multifaceted aesthetic interiors. Moreover, we highlight some of the challenges to building interactive interior objects, furniture and accessories, such as supporting sustained user engagements over time and designing for daily use within domestic environments with all its social, ethical and behavioural implications.","OUI Interiors can create computationally-driven interactive spaces, potentially changing physical appearances like shape, color, pattern, or texture, enhancing living experiences.",phrase,1491,179.0

204,does metacognition improves learning?,Digital Teaching Materials and Their Relationship with the Metacognitive Skills of Students in Primary Education,"Metacognition is a construct that is noteworthy for its relationship with the prediction and enhancement of student performance. It is of interest in education, as well as in the field of cognitive psychology, because it contributes to competencies, such as learning to learn and the understanding of information. This study conducted research at a state school in the Community of Madrid (Spain) with a sample of 130 students in Grade 3 of their primary education (8 years old). The research involved the use of a digital teaching platform called Smile and Learn, as the feedback included in the digital activities may have an effect on students’ metacognition. We analyzed the implementation of the intelligent platform at school and the activities most commonly engaged in. The Junior Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (Jr. MAI) was the measuring instrument chosen for the external evaluation of metacognition. The study’s results show a higher use of logic and spatial activities. A relationship is observed between the use of digital exercises that have specific feedback and work on logic and visuospatial skills with metacognitive knowledge. We discuss our findings surrounding educational implications, metacognition assessment, and recommendations for improvements of the digital materials.",Using digital exercises with specific feedback and focusing on logic and visuospatial skills is related to improved metacognitive knowledge.,question,1299,140.0

Collaborative engagement in an interprofessional community of practice is crucial to the collective competence of a team and the provision of high-quality, safe health care leading to improved patient outcomes. The objective of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to describe interprofessional communication, coordination, and collaboration of participants in an integrated practice unit that was structured to include weekly case conferences as part of routine practice. Methods: Data were collected from October 2019 to February 2020. Web-based surveys were administered to a convenience sample that included 33 questions and followed the CHERRIES checklist for reporting results. Items focused on team knowledge, impact on patient care, and communication, and conference focus and effectiveness. Descriptive and survey item analysis included frequency, percentage, means and standard deviation, Chi-square, and Pearson correlation analysis. Patient outcome data were collected via a Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale and were analyzed using a paired sample t test. Results: Survey respondents (n = 161) included clinicians and administrative staff. Results demonstrated that interprofessional case conferences improved the collective competence of the team, including team knowledge and communication. Participants viewed case conferences as a means to enhance care delivery quality, value, safety, and equity. In the study period, there was also a statistically significant improvement between the patient's first follow-up and last visits. Conclusion: Survey respondents indicated that case conferences were an effective means to deliver high-quality, patient-centered care through interprofessional collaboration and education.","Interprofessional case conferences improved the collective competence of the team, enhancing care delivery quality, value, safety, and equity, leading to significant patient improvement.",phrase,1878,186.0
1880,did title ix increase womens participation in sports?,Title IX: Boom or Bust?.,"Athletics has been significantly impacted by Title IX through an increase the number of female athletes, the number of teams available, and indirectly, the development of women's professional leagues. However, women in leadership positions in athletics have declined significantly since Title IX was signed into law. A concern about the discontinuation of some men's non-revenue producing sports influenced the Department of Education to form the Commission on Opportunities in Athletics to review Title IX. The process and findings of the Commission are discussed, as well as the possible impact of the Commission's recommendations. On June 23, 2002, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 celebrated its 30th birthday. Title IX applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funding, and to various parts of those institutions. The law has had periods of weakness and strength over its 30year history, but through the decade ofthe 90's has shown increasing power and consistency in the court system. Eight of the twelve U. S. Courts of Appeals have ruled in support of the present administrative regulations and Congressional hearings on Title IX have not brought any changes (Bonnette & von Euler, 2003). Although Title IX has positively assisted in an increase of women attending law and medical schools for example, it has most significantly impacted in athletics. It is in this area that this paper will focus. Participation Increases In the year 2000-01, boys continued to participate at a rate of almost 4 million a year in High School Athletics, while girls' participation has skyrocketed to the level of almost 2,750,000. In 1971, 1 in 27 girls participated in high school sports, while in 2000-01, the rate is 1 in 2.5. For boys, the number has remained at 1 in 2. (Women's Sports Foundation, 2002). A parallel increase of women's participation can be seen in college athletics. Acosta and Carpenter (2002) indicate that in 1970 colleges sponsored an average of2.5 women's athletic teams. In the mandatory compliance year for Title IX of 1977-78, the average number ofteams sponsored had risen to 5.61. In 2002, women's intercollegiate sport sponsorship is at an all time high of 8.35 sponsored teams per school. All three of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Divisions have continued to show increases in women's sport sponsorship. Acosta and Carpenter (2002) attribute the increase of women's intercollegiate participation to several factors: (a) second generation female athletes, (b) successful Title IX lawsuits, (c) society's greater acceptance of female athletes, (d) greater media time focused on female athletes, and (e) commitment of individuals and organizations to full access for males and females. Although not directly attributed to Title IX, the boom in participation of female athletes in educational settings has assisted in the development of professional playing opportunities for women. Society has traditionally accepted individual women's sports such as tennis, bowling and golf, and has long offered women the opportunity to make a living playing the games they love. Billiards has now been added to the professional opportunities for women in individual sports. In recent years, the prize money for women has begun to approach that of men, and is now equal at the u.s. Open Tennis Championship. Professional team sports for women have now developed in several areas. The backing of the National Basketball Association has provided high visibility for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The success of the World Cup in the United States has spawned the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA). Football, the formerly all-male bastion, has been infiltrated by the Women's Professional Football League (WPFL). United States Professional Volleyball (USPV) begins their second season in 2004. Play will be restarted in professional softball in 2003 with the Women's Professional Softball League (WPSL). Salaries of the female team sports athletes do not rival those of major men's sports, but for the first time, women in a number ofteam sports are being paid to play. Decline of Women in Leadership Roles While the boom of participation has been skyrocketing, a corresponding bust of women in leadership roles has been occurring. Only 44% of the coaches in women's sports on the college level are female. The percentage of women coaching in men's athletics remains under 2%, as it has for the past 3 decades. This translates into less than 25% of all college coaches being female (Acosta & Carpenter, 2002). When Title IX was enacted in 1972, more than 90% of all women's intercollegiate athletic programs were directed by a female. In 2002, 17.9% of women's intercollegiate athletics programs were directed by a female head administrator. 18.8% of women's athletics programs have no female in the athletic administrative structure. Women hold 40% of the administrative jobs, but only 17.9% of the athletic directorships (Acosta & Carpenter, 2002). Other positions of leadership in intercollegiate athletic departments include Sports Information Directors and Athletic Trainers. Of the 854 full-time Sports Information Directors, 12.3% are females. 703 institutions provide full-time Athletic Trainers, with 27.8% being female (Acosta & Carpenter, 2002). After Title IX was signed into law, the consolidation of Men and Women's Athletic Departments accelerated the decline of women in college athletic administration. The title of Athletic Director was most often bestowed upon the former Men's Athletic Director, with the Women's Athletic Director becoming an Assistant. On the High School level, the girls' programs were begun or absorbed into the athletic department with the male Athletic Director in charge. The reasons for the decline of women in coaching are complex and have no clearly defined rationale. Prior to Title IX, over 90% of the coaches of women athletes were female. An occupation that is conventionally female has lower status in our society than an occupation that is conventionally male (Crampton & Mishra, 1999; Jacobsen & Moore, 1995). Together with reduced prestige, women in traditionally female occupations receive lower wages, less autonomy, less job security and less mobility than men in comparable masculine occupations (Reskin & Roos, 1990). Therefore, the masculinization of female occupations rarely happens (Jacobsen & Moore, 1995; Reskin & Roos, 1990; Williams, 1989). Williams (1993) has identified situations where men may move into a ""women's"" occupation. An invasion occurs when large numbers of men enter a job, monopolizing certain specialties and taking top hierarchical positions. Involved is a perception of real economic opportunity and a climate of social or technological change that men can exploit.

14378,current hot questions in behavioural biology,Using an integrative approach to investigate the evolution of behaviour,"Behaviour is a central focus of interest in biology because it has an impact on several aspects of an organism's life. Evolutionary biologists have realised the advantage of an integrative approach that jointly studies the molecular, cellular and physiological levels of an individual to link them with the organismal behavioural phenotype. First, this mechanistic information helps in understanding physiological and evolutionary constraints acting on the behavioural response to the environment and its evolution. Second, it furthers our understanding of the process of molecular convergent evolution. Finally, we learn about natural variation in molecular, cellular and physiological traits present in wild populations and their underlying genetic basis, which can be a substrate for selection to act on. I illustrate these points using our work on behaviour variation in fishes. The information on the mechanistic bases of behaviour variation in various species and behaviours will contribute to an ecological annotation of genes and to uncover new mechanisms implicated in how this astonishing behavioural diversity arose, is maintained and will evolve.","An integrative approach studying molecular, cellular, and physiological levels helps understand constraints on behavioral evolution and molecular convergent evolution in fishes.",phrase,1158,177.0

5977,effect of emotional neglection to child?,New insights on affective morbidity and childhood maltreatment,"Childhood maltreatment (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, and physical or emotional neglect, by a parent, caregiver or other adult) is a major problem of global significance. Children who suffered maltreatment of any kind are known to experience a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, eating disorders, suicidal symptomatology and personality disorder. These problems often emerge in childhood and last through adulthood to old age. Furthermore, people with a history of childhood maltreatment show a worse-than-usual response to standard treatment approaches to improve their mental health. There is growing evidence that emotional abuse, one of the most prevalent forms of childhood maltreatment, may have the most wide-ranging impact of all maltreatment types on mental health outcomes as it appears to be a transdiagnostic risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, and found to me more strongly associated with development of affective disorders than physical abuse or neglect. There is a need to move beyond simple association studies and shift the research focus on sophisticated multimodal studies to fully understand the psychobiological mechanisms underlying affective morbidity, as well as the protective factors that might promote resilience, in the face of (specific forms of) childhood maltreatment.

6236,does public complaint on construction site?,Convolutional neural network: Deep learning-based classification of building quality problems,"Abstract The rapid development of the construction industry in China has introduced unprecedented quality-related problems in the country’s building industry. In response to this issue, the government has established various complaint channels to report quality problems. Therefore, building quality complaints (BQCs) need to be classified and solved by respective agencies or departments rapidly for avoiding adverse impact on the safety, health, and well-being of people. However, the current process of classifying BQCs is labor intensive, time consuming, and error prone. An automatic complaint classification is required to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of complaint handling, but studies on this issue are limited. Prevailing text classification research in construction has focused on utilizing conventional shallow machine learning. By contrast, this study explores a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that incorporates a deep-learning method to automatically classify the short texts contained within BQCs. The presented approach enables capturing the semantic features in BQC texts and automatic classification of the BQCs into predefined categories. After the model optimization, tests are conducted to examine the practical application of the text classification approach compared with Bayes-based and support vector machine classifiers. Results indicate that the developed CNN-based approach performs well in the Chinese BQC classification with limited manual intervention and few complicated feature engineering.","The study presents a deep-learning method using convolutional neural networks to automatically classify building quality complaints, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of complaint handling.",question,1559,198.0

9948,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Accreditation—Some Background and Observations,"The fields of health, education, and welfare have always shown an active interest in the quality of their programs. Experience in each has shown that one of the most effective methods for improving services has been the establishment of systems of accreditation. Accreditation has been defined as the ""recognition accorded to an institution that meets the standards or criteria established by a competent agency or association. Its general purpose is to promote and inspire high quality of services.':* Accreditation is primarily a means for assuring competence in performance for a hospital, a high school, a university, a social agency, etc. It is an assurance to the public that the accredited agency or institution is well organized, well administered, well staffed and well equipped, and it affords a protection to the public against substandard services. A lengthy account could be written of accreditation as a method of social control. However, it is a well-known fact that groups, institutional representatives, and professional persons with mutual interests find it helpful to discuss common problems. Out of this mutuality of interest and the necessity of detemilning who should become members of these groups certain criteria or standards are developed.

19649,how to define free-ranging-dogs?,Free-ranging dogs prefer petting over food in repeated interactions with unfamiliar humans,"ABSTRACT Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are the first species to have been domesticated and, unlike other domesticated species, they have developed a special bond with their owners. The ability to respond to human gestures and language, and the hypersocial behaviours of dogs are considered key factors that have led them to become man's best friend. Free-ranging dogs provide an excellent model system for understanding the dog–human relationship in various social contexts. In India, free-ranging dogs occur in all possible human habitations. They scavenge among garbage, beg for food from humans, give birth in dens close to human habitations, and establish social bonds with people. However, there is ample dog–human conflict on the streets, leading to morbidity and mortality of dogs. Hence, the ability to assess an unfamiliar human before establishing physical contact could be adaptive for dogs, especially in the urban environment. We tested a total of 103 adult dogs to investigate their response to immediate social and long-term food and social rewards. The dogs were provided a choice of obtaining food either from an experimenter's hand or the ground. The dogs avoided making physical contact with the unfamiliar human. While immediate social reward was not effective in changing this response, the long-term test showed a strong effect of social contact. Our results revealed that these dogs tend to build trust based on affection, not food. This study provides significant insights into the dynamics of dog–human interactions on the streets and subsequent changes in behaviour of dogs through the process of learning. Summary: Free-ranging dogs are generally aversive towards making direct human contact for food. Interestingly, they show enhanced interactions with humans who provide them with positive social contact.","Free-ranging dogs build trust based on affection, not food, and show enhanced interactions with humans who provide positive social contact.",question,1834,139.0
7466,factor impacts market capitalisation,Push vs. Pull Factors of Capital Flows Revisited: A Cross-country Analysis,"Capital market integration contributes to economic growth and it can be more beneficial for emerging market economies (EMEs, hereafter) at their early stages of development where the capital is relatively insufficient. An open capital market also enables investor to share the country-specific risks by holding foreign assets. However, there are also some negative side effects of capital market integration. Financial shocks originating in the center country can be quickly propagated through the integrated financial market. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC, hereafter) is a good example of the contagion of the financial crisis. Volatile cross-border capital inflows and outflows negatively affect financial stability, which eventually lowers economic growth by causing financial crises.<br><br>Despite of these negative side effects, capital market integration has been an inevitable long-term trend for many EMEs over the past few decades (Aizenman et al. 2010). There have been continuous capital flows to EMEs, which started even before GFC and this trend has been more pronounced during the U.S. zero-interest rate period (Ahmed and Zlate 2014). Though some monetary authorities in EMEs tried to moderate the procyclicality of credit flows by implementing policy instruments such as capital controls or macro-prudential policy measures after GFC (Kim and Mehrotra 2018), the common factors in the global financial market still play a crucial role in determining capital inflows to EMEs.<br> <br>The relationship between the global financial condition and its impact on capital inflows to EMEs, has been a long-debated issue. This issue concerns whether push or pull factors are the major determinant of capital flows. The push factor represents the common factor that exists in the global financial market or center countries, which influences capital inflows to peripheral countries. These factors are interest rates and GDP growth rates of advanced economies (AEs, hereafter), global risk factors such as VIX (S&amp;P 500 Volatility Index), and the commodity price index. The pull factor denotes domestic factors that attract funds from the global financial market to domestic financial markets. These factors are domestic interest rates, domestic GDP growth rates, and other country-specific characteristics such as exchange rate regime, degree of the capital account openness, institutional quality, and stages of economic development. <br><br>In previous literature, many scholars have found strong evidence for push factors being the major determinant of capital movement. The interest rates of mature economies and VIX are significant determinants of capital inflows to EMEs. However, there is only some evidence that higher domestic interest rates and higher domestic GDP growth rates pull capital from the center countries to individual EMEs (Koepke 2015).<br><br>Related to this long-debated issue in academia, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell recently stated, ""... I will argue that, while global factors play an important role in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often exaggerated."" With this statement, he also pointed out that the slowdown in capital inflows to EMEs which has been happening ever since 2011 has been mainly due to the narrowing of GDP gaps between AEs and EMEs, i.e., the recent decrease in capital in-flows to EMEs can be attributed to the decline in EMEs' GDP growth rates given the fact that the U.S. GDP growth rate has picked up.<br><br>In this paper, we revisit this issue of push and pull factors of capital inflows. To this end, we consider the heterogeneity that exists in EMEs by dividing them into four subgroups. We investigate which is the main driver of capital inflows between push and pull factors across country groups. Categorizing subgroups is important for two reasons. First, EMEs are so heterogeneous that we make subgroups which share similar economic fundamentals by regions. Second, making subgroups across EMEs is an effective way to indirectly consider the regional contagion effect. With this cross-country analysis, we can figure out the differing effects of push and pull factors across country groups, and this can eventually lead to the development and implementation of appropriate policy instruments. <br><br>Our empirical finding shows that the push and pull factors play a different role in determining capital inflows to AEs and EMEs. The major drivers of capital inflows to AEs are both push and pull factors, but push factors turn out to be the main determinant of capital inflows to EMEs. When EMEs are divided into four subgroups, we find sizable heterogeneity across subgroups. In Asian countries, both push and pull factors are significant, which is similar to AEs, but only U.S. interest rate plays a major role in Eastern Europe. Some pull factors are important in Latin American countries and other EMEs, but these are not robust to alternative empirical models and measures.","Push factors, such as interest rates and GDP growth rates of advanced economies, are the main determinants of capital inflows to emerging market economies.",phrase,5027,155.0
1603,few shot classification,BaseTransformers: Attention over base data-points for One Shot Learning,"Few shot classification aims to learn to recognize novel categories using only limited samples per category. Most current few shot methods use a base dataset rich in labeled examples to train an encoder that is used for obtaining representations of support instances for novel classes. Since the test instances are from a distribution different to the base distribution, their feature representations are of poor quality, degrading performance. In this paper we propose to make use of the well-trained feature representations of the base dataset that are closest to each support instance to improve its representation during meta-test time. To this end, we propose BaseTransformers, that attends to the most relevant regions of the base dataset feature space and improves support instance representations. Experiments on three benchmark data sets show that our method works well for several backbones and achieves state-of-the-art results in the inductive one shot setting.

12522,effects of the use of blockchain technology in accounting: on performance of selected manufacturing,BLOCKCHAIN AS A POWERFUL TOOL IN THE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT,"Abstract. The use of various electronic gadgets and Internet communication has accelerated the company development in various areas of its activities, including in terms of accounting. 
The tools of accounting and the peculiarity of blockchain technologies use in the field of accounting for the increase of its efficiency and errors prevention are considered in the article. In addition to this, the structure of these technologies, the basic principles of work are described, and also advantages and lacks are analyzed. 
It is given to determine the possibility of using companies that use the locking system in the accounting system. Blockchain technology is known and especially important. In recent years, it has proven its effectiveness in increasing the profits of companies that use it. This technology allows to significantly reduce the costs of companies, especially those that are participants in the stock market, and maintain high stability and strengthening of market positions. You can use it to reduce data processing resources and increase the number of information flows. 
Companies that use the blockchain system in the accounting field are revealed. One of the leading companies that uses this technology in Ukraine is Nexia DK. The advantage of using blockchain technology is that it allows a company to record both sides of a transaction simultaneously in a shared real-time ledger, rather than simply storing verified records of financial transactions in separate privately created databases or ledgers. 
Blockchain technology is also used by the international company Nestle in the field of trade, through which retailers, logistics companies and manufacturers can track goods as they move along their supply chain.

3242,Does decriminalizing drugs increase usage?,"Cannabis use among U.S. adolescents in the era of marijuana legalization: a review of changing use patterns, comorbidity, and health correlates","Abstract Decriminalization, medicalization, and legalization of cannabis use by a majority of U.S. states over the past 25 years have dramatically shifted societal perceptions and use patterns among Americans. How marijuana policy changes have affected population-wide health of U.S. youth and what the downstream public health implications of marijuana legalization are topics of significant debate. Cannabis remains the most commonly used federally illicit psychoactive drug by U.S. adolescents and is the main drug for which U.S. youth present for substance use treatment. Converging evidence indicates that adolescent-onset cannabis exposure is associated with short- and possibly long-term impairments in cognition, worse academic/vocational outcomes, and increased prevalence of psychotic, mood, and addictive disorders. Odds of negative developmental outcomes are increased in youth with early-onset, persistent, high frequency, and high-potency Δ-9-THC cannabis use, suggesting dose-dependent relationships. Cannabis use disorders are treatable conditions with clear childhood antecedents that respond to targeted prevention and early intervention strategies. This review indicates that marijuana policy changes have had mixed effects on U.S. adolescent health including potential benefits from decriminalization and negative health outcomes evidenced by increases in cannabis-related motor vehicle accidents, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Federal and state legislatures should apply a public health framework and consider the possible downstream effects of marijuana policy change on paediatric health.","Marijuana policy changes have had mixed effects on U.S. adolescent health, including potential benefits from decriminalization and negative health outcomes.",question,1632,156.0

3699,does the head trauma effect the cognitive performance,Cognitive sequelae of repeated head injury in a population of intravenous drug users.,"The relationship between closed head injury and performance on neuropsychological (NP) tests was investigated in a group of intravenous drug users (IVDUs). Subjects with repeated head traumas involving loss of consciousness (LOC) performed worse than both a control group without LOC and reference group with only a single episode of LOC. There were no significant differences between the last two groups. Performance on tests of memory, attention, and motor performance was significantly worse in the group with repeated head injury. The average time since the last episode of LOC was more than 11 years. We conclude from these findings that a single episode of LOC does not result in significant cognitive impairment in this population. Two or more episodes, however, are more likely to produce chronic cognitive impairment.","Repeated head traumas involving loss of consciousness lead to worse performance on memory, attention, and motor performance tests, indicating chronic cognitive impairment.",question,826,171.0

10288,sexual orientation impact on psychosis,Brain structure changes associated with sexual orientation,"Biological sex differences in brain function and structure are reliably associated with several cortico-subcortical brain regions. While sexual orientation (hetero- versus homosexuality) has been similarly linked to functional differences in several phylogenetically-old brain areas, the research on morphological brain phenotypes associated with sexual orientation is far from conclusive. We examined potential cerebral structural differences linked to sexual orientation in a group of 74 participants, including 37 men (21 homosexual) and 37 women (19 homosexual) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Gray matter volumes (GMV) were compared with respect to sexual orientation and biological sex across the entire sample using full factorial designs controlling for total intracranial volume, age, handedness, and education. We observed a significant effect of sexual orientation for the thalamus and precentral gyrus, with more GMV in heterosexual versus homosexual individuals, and for the putamen, with more GMV in homosexual + than heterosexual individuals. We found significant interactions between biological sex and sexual orientation, indicating that the significant effect for the putamen cluster was driven by homosexual women, whereas heterosexual women had increased precentral gyrus GMV. Heterosexual men exhibited more GMV in the thalamus than homosexual men. This study shows that sexual orientation is reflected in brain structure characteristics and that these differ between the sexes. The results emphasize the need to include or control for potential effects of participants’ sexual orientation in neuroimaging studies. Furthermore, our findings provide important new insights into the brain morphology underlying sexual orientation and likely have important implications for understanding brain functions and behavior.","Sexual orientation is reflected in brain structure characteristics, with differences observed in the thalamus, precentral gyrus, and putamen between heterosexual and homosexual individuals.",phrase,1840,189.0
1422,what is the impact of exercise before pregnancy on improving pregnancy rates?,Effect of recreational exercise on pregnancy weight gain and subcutaneous fat deposition.,"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuing a regular regimen of recreational endurance exercise alters the time-specific rate of maternal weight gain and subcutaneous fat deposition during pregnancy. Serial measurements of body mass and 5-site skinfold thickness were obtained from 44 women before and during pregnancy who continued their preconceptional exercise regimen throughout pregnancy and from women who voluntarily stopped their preconceptional exercise regimen either before conception (N = 31) or reduced it below baseline fitness levels in very early pregnancy (N = 4). In the first and second trimester, the rate of weight gain and change in skinfold thicknesses were unrelated to exercise performance. However, those who continued exercise had a reduced rate of weight gain and change in skinfold thickness at specific sites in the last trimester of pregnancy. Overall weight gains were (mean +/- SEM) 13.0 +/- 0.5 kg and 16.3 +/- 0.7 kg in the exercise and control groups, respectively, and the increases in the sum of skinfolds were 22 +/- 2 mm and 31 +/- 2 mm, respectively. We conclude that continuing a regular exercise regimen throughout pregnancy does not influence the rate of early pregnancy weight gain or subcutaneous fat deposition but decreases both in late pregnancy. However, overall pregnancy weight gain remains well within the normal range.","Continuing a regular exercise regimen throughout pregnancy decreases weight gain and subcutaneous fat deposition in late pregnancy, but does not impact early pregnancy weight gain.",question,1392,180.0

12122,Does artificial sweetener damage your gut?,Inhibitory Effects of Artificial Sweeteners on Bacterial Quorum Sensing,"Despite having been tagged as safe and beneficial, recent evidence remains inconclusive regarding the status of artificial sweeteners and their putative effects on gut microbiota. Gut microorganisms are essential for the normal metabolic functions of their host. These microorganisms communicate within their community and regulate group behaviors via a molecular system termed quorum sensing (QS). In the present study, we aimed to study the effects of artificial sweeteners on this bacterial communication system. Using biosensor assays, biophysical protein characterization methods, microscale thermophoresis, swarming motility assays, growth assays, as well as molecular docking, we show that aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin have significant inhibitory actions on the Gram-negative bacteria N-acyl homoserine lactone-based (AHL) communication system. Our studies indicate that these three artificial sweeteners are not bactericidal. Protein-ligand docking and interaction profiling, using LasR as a representative participating receptor for AHL, suggest that the artificial sweeteners bind to the ligand-binding pocket of the protein, possibly interfering with the proper housing of the native ligand and thus impeding protein folding. Our findings suggest that these artificial sweeteners may affect the balance of the gut microbial community via QS-inhibition. We, therefore, infer an effect of these artificial sweeteners on numerous molecular events that are at the core of intestinal microbial function, and by extension on the host metabolism.","Artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin may affect the balance of the gut microbial community via quorum sensing-inhibition, potentially impacting host metabolism.",question,1557,186.0

Flexibility is influenced by many factors such as anatomical condition, gender, body mass index, age, physical activity, injury, and training experience. The hamstring muscles are primarily fast-twitch and powerful movement types, so that the hamstrings are resistant to overloading but tire quickly on excessive repetitions. Excessive activity that involves contracting the hamstring muscles will cause the hamstring muscles to experience decreased flexibility. The purpose of this study was to prove the difference in the effect of giving neurodynamic slider and neurodynamic tension on increasing hamstring muscle flexibility.

102,why do people cheat or engage in infidelity?,Your Cheatin’ Voice Will Tell on You: Detection of Past Infidelity from Voice,"Evidence suggests that many physical, behavioral, and trait qualities can be detected solely from the sound of a person’s voice, irrespective of the semantic information conveyed through speech. This study examined whether raters could accurately assess the likelihood that a person has cheated on committed, romantic partners simply by hearing the speaker’s voice. Independent raters heard voice samples of individuals who self-reported that they either cheated or had never cheated on their romantic partners. To control for aspects that may clue a listener to the speaker’s mate value, we used voice samples that did not differ between these groups for voice attractiveness, age, voice pitch, and other acoustic measures. We found that participants indeed rated the voices of those who had a history of cheating as more likely to cheat. Male speakers were given higher ratings for cheating, while female raters were more likely to ascribe the likelihood to cheat to speakers. Additionally, we manipulated the pitch of the voice samples, and for both sexes, the lower pitched versions were consistently rated to be from those who were more likely to have cheated. Regardless of the pitch manipulation, speakers were able to assess actual history of infidelity; the one exception was that men’s accuracy decreased when judging women whose voices were lowered. These findings expand upon the idea that the human voice may be of value as a cheater detection tool and very thin slices of vocal information are all that is needed to make certain assessments about others.","People may be perceived as more likely to cheat if they have a lower-pitched voice, but the abstract does not explain why people cheat or engage in infidelity.",question,1568,159.0
13984,how to balancing class in fraud detection ecommerce using machine learning?,Automatic Machine Learning Algorithms for Fraud Detection in Digital Payment Systems,"Data on global financial statistics demonstrate that total losses from fraudulent transactions around the world are constantly growing. The issue of payment fraud will be exacerbated by the digitalization of economic relations, in particular the introduction by banks of the concept of ""Bank-as-a-Service"", which will increase the burden on payment services. The aim of this study is to synthesize effective models for detecting fraud in digital payment systems using automated machine learning and Big Data analysis algorithms. Approaches to expanding the information base to detect fraudulent transactions have been proposed and systematized. The choice of performance metrics for building and comparing models has been substantiated. The use of automatic machine learning algorithms has been proposed to resolve the issue, which makes it possible in a short time to go through a large number of variants of models, their ensembles, and input data sets. As a result, our experiments allowed us to obtain the quality of classification based on the AUC metric at the level of 0.977‒0.982. This exceeds the effectiveness of the classifiers developed by traditional methods, even as the time spent on the synthesis of the models is much less and measured in hours. The models' ensemble has made it possible to detect up to 85.7 % of fraudulent transactions in the sample. The accuracy of fraud detection is also high (79‒85 %). The results of our study confirm the effectiveness of using automatic machine learning algorithms to synthesize fraud detection models in digital payment systems. In this case, efficiency is manifested not only by the resulting classifiers' quality but also by the reduction in the cost of their development, as well as by the high potential of interpretability.

This article examines some of the complex temporal dimensions of the migration process. It reveals that time has often appeared as an important dimension in various accounts of immigration. On the basis of empirical research conducted with a particular immigrant group, namely Brazilians in London, the article suggests a number of conceptual tools for the analysis of the temporal aspects of migration. This conceptual framework is based on the development of the notions of the strange, heteronomous, asynchronous, remembered, collage, liminal, diasporic and nomadic times of migration.

This study examined how AI art alters people’s evaluation, purchase intention, and collection intention toward Chinese-style and Western-style paintings, and whether art expertise plays a role. Study 1 recruited participants without professional art experience (non-experts) and found that those who made the paintings would not change their liking rating, purchase intention, and collection intention. In addition, they showed ingroup preference, favoring Chinese-style relative to Western-style paintings, in line with previous evidence on cultural preference in empirical aesthetics. Study 2 further investigated the modulation effect of art expertise.

5048,what are the main determinants of our moral psychology and worldview?,A topography of the empiricist theories of law,"In the Introduction, Kant’s idealistic interpretation of moral consciousness was countered with Freud’s empiricist explanation. For Kant, moral consciousness forms the supersensible higher part of the human personality, which links man to a rational, absolute world, not bound by the contingencies of time and space. This higher world sets a standard by which the world of the senses — the world of natural phenomena — can be measured. It is the intervention of the moral consciousness which enables man to gain some knowledge of this standard. Freud also takes as his starting-point the fact that human beings possess an awareness of norms which present themselves forcefully as the only correct standard of behaviour. But he does not have such a great respect for this consciousness as Kant. For Freud certainly does not regard it as a higher supersensible part of man, but rather as a natural component of his psychic condition. This can be empirically explained as such by the science of psychology. Nor does our moral consciousness help us to know which mode of behaviour is absolutely correct, according to Freud. Moral judgements do not refer to ideal truth: they are neither true nor untrue, but are abstractions of irrational impulses. In Freud’s explanation, every child is so dependent on those who bring him up, that he internalizes their norms, which are themselves socially determined. These then become a separate element of the personality which has a critical and imperative function in relation to the rest of the personality. From then on, the child spontaneously imposes these norms on himself. Since this normative consciousness is in opposition to the rest of the personality, and adults are not even aware of its origin, it is perceived by man as the manifestation of an objective order of unconditionally valid norms. But Freud maintains that the objective existence of such norms is based on an illusion, since it is in fact only the prejudices of the parents and the social environment which are being manifested.",Freud's empiricist explanation suggests that our moral psychology and worldview are determined by the internalization of socially determined norms from our upbringing.,question,2039,167.0
13509,why does dipterocarp seedlings showed negative relative growth rate?,Patterns of dynamic irradiance affect the photosynthetic capacity and growth of dipterocarp tree seedlings,"In the deeply shaded understorey of S.E. Asian rain forests the growth and survival of dipterocarp seedlings is limited by their ability to maintain a positive carbon balance. Photosynthesis during sunflecks is an important component of carbon gain in understorey plants. To test the sensitivity of photosynthesis and growth to variation in the pattern of dynamic irradiance, dipterocarp tree seedlings (Shorea leprosula and Hopea nervosa) were grown for 370 days under shaded forest light treatments of equal total daily photosynthetic photon flux density (~3.3 mol m-2 day-1), but characterised by either long flecks (LF) or short flecks (SF). Seedling growth was more than 4-fold greater under LF, compared with SF, in both species. Variation in the relative growth rates (RGR) and light saturated rates of photosynthesis (Amax) were strongly positively correlated with the mean duration of sunflecks. Variation in RGR was strongly correlated with greater unit leaf rate growth, indicating that photosynthetic carbon gain per unit leaf area was greater under LF. The accumulation of starch in leaves over the diurnal period was 117% greater in both species under LF, compared with SF. Greater carbon gain in seedlings under LF is likely to have resulted from the combination of (1) greater Amax (S. leprosula 35%, H. nervosa 40%), (2) more efficient dynamic photosynthesis, and (3) greater incident photosynthetic quantum yield, compared with seedlings receiving the SF irradiance treatment. The pattern of dynamic irradiance received by seedlings may significantly impact their growth and survival to a previously unrecognised extent, with important consequences for regeneration processes and hence forest structure and composition.","Dipterocarp seedlings show negative relative growth rate due to their sensitivity to variation in dynamic irradiance patterns, affecting photosynthesis and carbon gain.",question,1737,168.0
23026,what are multidisciplinary field in organizational behaviour,Behavioural medicine: an integration of psychology and health,"The process of evolution in health sciences has followed a similar path from being analytical to synthesized or holistic. Multidisciplinary approach has taken over the specialized approach in the area of health care delivery that follows bio-psycho-social paradigm in the understanding and management of health problems in the general hospital setting. Emergene of Behavioural Medicine is the result of such evolutionary process. Behavioural Medicine is the interdisciplinary field concerned with the development and integration of behavioural and biomedical sciences, knowledge, and techniques relevant to health and illness and the application of this knowledge and these techniques to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. The present article reviews the historical aspects of the emergence of Behavioural Medicine on the background of biopsychosocial model and impact of life-style factors on health along with the clinical application and role of Behavioural Medicine in the primary prevention. Relevance of Behavioural Medicine in the context of Nepal, and the contribution of clinical psychologists in the health care system of the country along with the need for accepting them in the mainstream of health professionals are highlighted.","Behavioural Medicine is a multidisciplinary field that integrates behavioural and biomedical sciences for health and illness prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.",question,1260,178.0
2107,what is the use of renin inhibitors in alzheimer's?,Current status of renin–aldosterone angiotensin system-targeting anti-hypertensive drugs as therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease,"Introduction: Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Yet, despite this well-documented association, few of the current strategies to treat AD are directed at this possible target. The renin–aldosterone angiotensin system (RAAS) is a centrally active modifiable pathway that is involved in cerebral blood flow regulation. Currently, three classes of RAAS-targeting drugs are licensed for treatment of peripheral hypertension – angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). All of these are generally well tolerated and have been shown to offer varying degrees of protection on aspects of cognition and dementia, thus making them an attractive therapeutic option for AD. Areas covered: This review summarises existing evidence regarding the plausibility of using RAAS-targeting drugs as a strategy to treat AD and highlights unresolved aspects to such approaches, namely the potential impact of altering angiotensin II-mediated processes in the central nervous system. Expert opinion: Continued biochemical research of the RAAS pathway in combination with formal investigation of current RAAS-modifying drugs in randomised clinical trials is now necessary to determine their therapeutic value in AD.","RAAS-targeting drugs, including renin inhibitors, offer varying degrees of protection on cognition and dementia, making them a potential therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease.",question,1330,180.0
9572,does taking antihypertensive medications in the morning and at night affect outcomes?,Should blood pressure medications be taken at bedtime?,"Hypertension is a common problem that increases cardiovascular risk. A recent large trial suggests the timing of treatment can make a difference to outcomes .

Accumulating evidence shows that the time of day that antihypertensives are taken can impact their effectiveness: taking them at night reduces asleep blood pressure (BP), without compromising their effect on daytime BP.1 Asleep BP is also a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than daytime measurements and non-dipping during sleep, defined as a decline of less than a 10% in systolic pressure, is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.2

In 2010, a randomised trial including 2156 hypertensives, taking ≥1 BP-lowering medication at bedtime, reported significant reductions in night-time BP and cardiovascular events at a mean 5.6 years of follow-up.3 However, the generalisability of the trial findings was limited by the single-centre design and the small sample size of the study. Replication of these findings in a much larger primary care population was therefore needed.

996,Can intergroup contact cause racism?,A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory.,"The present article presents a meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. With 713 independent samples from 515 studies, the meta-analysis finds that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.","Intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice, not causing racism.",question,1375,78.0
6347,Can intergroup contact cause racism?,The benefit of contact for prejudice-prone individuals: The type of stigmatized outgroup matters,"ABSTRACT Intergroup contact reduces prejudice against a variety of social outgroups and seems to be particularly effective at reducing prejudice in individuals most prone to it—those high in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). The present study examines the moderating roles of RWA and SDO in the contact-prejudice relationship, targeting dissident, dangerous, and derogated outgroups: lesbians and gay men, people with schizophrenia, and Indigenous Australians, respectively. In total, 234 participants self-reported contact and prejudice against these outgroups and completed RWA and SDO scales. Contact predicted less prejudice against lesbians and gay men and Indigenous Australians in participants high in RWA and participants high in SDO. However, contact only predicted less prejudice against people with schizophrenia in participants low in RWA or SDO. The results suggest that the ability for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice in prejudice-prone individuals may depend on the outgroup targeted, specifically the threat they pose and the level of prejudice held against them.","Intergroup contact reduces prejudice, especially in individuals with high right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, but its effectiveness depends on the targeted outgroup and their perceived threat.",question,1126,218.0
16024,Can homeopathy cure disease?,Homeopathy--between tradition and modern science: remedies as carriers of significance.,"The healing potential and description of homeopathic remedies, as determined in homeopathic pathogenic trials (HPTs) and verified by medical experience, are often found to be meaningfully connected with the symbolic content attributed to the original materials (tinctures, metals etc) through tradition or modern semantics. Such a connection is incompatible with a biomolecular mechanistic explanation of the healing action of remedies. The physiological effects of crude substances are often similar to the symptoms of illnesses cured by the corresponding homeopathic remedy. This is considered a manifestation of the similia principle. Evidence is brought here that in several cases the inverse situation occurs, with the healing properties of the crude substance and those of its homeopathic preparation partially coinciding, the remedy usually having broader healing properties. The existence of these two possibilities in the relationship of medicinal actions of remedy and the crude substance, offers evidence in favor of a direct involvement of the level of significances in the mechanism underlying the homeopathic phenomenon. Finally, an experimental methodology is proposed, which may bring the result of double-blind randomized studies for homeopathic remedies closer to the reported performance of homeopathy in real life medical practice. If successful, this method would be a further indication of a non-local, significance-related interpretation of homeopathy.","Homeopathic remedies' healing potential is connected to the symbolic content of the original materials, but this connection is incompatible with a biomolecular mechanistic explanation of their healing action.",question,1475,208.0
13771,are there racial differences in police brutality?,Race and Worrying About Police Brutality: The Hidden Injuries of Minority Status in America,"ABSTRACT Given the historically contentious relationship – including most notably the use of excessive and lethal force – between the police and African Americans, the current project examines the extent to which Blacks in the United States fear police brutality. The study is based on a national-level survey (N = 1,000), and measures fear by how much respondents “worry” about experiencing police force. The data support the racial divide hypothesis, showing that Blacks’ worry about such violence is over five times that of Whites. Guided by the racial/ethnic gradient hypothesis, the analyses also assess Hispanic respondents’ level of worry. Rather than forming a gradient by falling midway between Blacks and Whites, Hispanics’ worry about police brutality more closely reflects those of Blacks at more than four times that of Whites, suggesting a racial/ethnic divide. These findings thus assert that worrying about police brutality is an emotional injury that minorities disproportionately experience and whose pervasiveness remains largely hidden from view.","Blacks' worry about police brutality is over five times that of Whites, and Hispanics' worry is more than four times that of Whites.",question,1066,132.0

Unfortunately, many students do not complete homework or do so with less accuracy. The present study examined the effects of Radical Raceway, a multi-component intervention package on the homework completion and accuracy of a ninth-grade social studies inclusion class. Radical Raceway produced immediate and consistent improvements in all students’ performance, including 10 adolescents with Individualized Education Plans.

","Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with untapped therapeutic potential. There are hints that the use of psychedelics can produce neural adaptations, although the extent and time scale of the impact in a mammalian brain are unknown. In this study, we used chronic two-photon microscopy to image longitudinally the apical dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We found that a single dose of psilocybin led to ∼10% increases in spine size and density, driven by an elevated spine formation rate. The structural remodeling occurred quickly within 24 hours and was persistent 1 month later. Psilocybin also ameliorated stress-related behavioral deficit and elevated excitatory neurotransmission. Overall, the results demonstrate that psilocybin-evoked synaptic rewiring in the cortex is fast and enduring, potentially providing a structural trace for long-term integration of experiences and lasting beneficial actions.","Psilocybin leads to a 10% increase in spine size and density in the brain, with structural remodeling occurring within 24 hours and persisting for 1 month.",question,964,155.0

20765,advantages and disadvantages of force field analysis,The PIMM Force Field - Recent Developments,"Even though the steady advances in computing power and algorithms continue to increase the competition by semiempirical and ab initio methods, they also serve to open new realms for modern force fields. Among the key advantages of the classical molecular mechanics approach is their ability to handle systems with a large number of atoms and degrees of freedom. A second and increasingly important feature lies in the fact that they can often provide a simple but efficient means of modeling metal complexes. In recent years, our PIMM force field [1] for organic molecules has found successful application in a number of problems in organic and bio-organic chemistry. Examples range from peptide complexes of alkaline earths cations to porphyrin complexes of the transition metals. In its traditional field, the conformational analysis of organic molecules, satisfying results have been reported especially for carbohydrates [2]. Besides conventional energy minimization techniques and systematic permutations, molecular dynamics calculations have gained increasing importance. In its current form, the program fills the niche between the small-molecule force fields and the protein modeling packages. Even on the pc platform, systems of up to 2000 atoms can readily be studied without simplifications. This entails not only an all-atom representation, but also a semiempirical SCF calculation of the pi electrons and a Hessian matrix-based optimization algorithm. Current projects address the specific continuum effects in condensed phases, i.e. a model representation of solvent and packing effects.","Force fields can handle large systems with many atoms and degrees of freedom, and efficiently model metal complexes.",phrase,1601,116.0

Methods We retrospectively examined patients with acute ICH treated in our institution from May 2018 to July 2020. Patient characteristics, laboratory testing data, radiologic imaging data, and 90-day outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Results Among the 329 patients included for analysis, 183 (55.6%) developed pneumonia. Systolic blood pressure, initial hematoma volume, D-dimer concentration, NLR, PLR, DFR, and white blood cell, platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts at admission were significantly higher in patients who developed pneumonia than in those who did not; however, the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score at admission was significantly lower in pneumonia patients compared with non-pneumonia patients (all P <0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the NLR and PLR were independent predictors of pneumonia, and the NLR and DFR were independent predictors of poor 90-day outcomes (modified Rankin scale score 4–6).

19653,why is it good to cry,Effects of infant cries on alcohol consumption in college males at risk for child abuse.,"This analog study examines the effect of hearing a child's cries on alcohol consumption, comprising one link in a possible association between drinking and child abuse. Thirty-two male undergraduate volunteers were preselected by age, drinking practices, and abuse potential. Subjects were assigned to either a high or low abuse potential group and were then randomly assigned to hear either an infant cry or a smoke alarm. Blood pressure was measured during each of three stimulus presentations. Following each presentation, the subject was asked to rate the stimulus on a number of different dimensions (e.g., soothing-arousing). Additionally all subjects participated in a subsequent taste-rating task as an unobtrusive measure of alcohol consumption. The results indicate that, regardless of risk group, subjects who listened to the infant cry consumed significantly more alcohol (M = 206 ml, SD = 126.43) during the taste-rating task than did those who heard only the smoke alarm (Mr = 95.68 ml, SD = 62.94) which was also rated as aversive. There was no relationship between abuse potential and alcohol consumption. Although diastolic blood pressure did not differ between groups, analysis of the infant rating scales revealed that, regardless of risk group, subjects who heard the infant cry reported feeling more aversion, arousal, and distress, than did those who heard the smoke alarm. These results lend additional support to studies depicting the infant cry as a stressful and aversive event, capable of eliciting increased drinking.

Prison and jail incarceration rates as well as community correctional populations have increased greatly since the mid-1970s. Both of these developments have disproportionately impacted poor and minority communities. In this paper, we document these trends. We then present an assessment of whether the crime declines can be attributed to the massive expansion of the U.S. criminal justice system. We argue that the crime is certainly lower as results of this expansion and the crime rate in the early 1990s was likely a third lower than what they would have been absent changes in sentencing practices in the 1980s. However, there is little evidence of an impact of the further stiffening of sentences during the 1990s, a period when prison and other correctional populations expanded rapidly. Hence, the growth in criminal justice populations since 1990s have exacerbated socioeconomic inequality in the U.S. without generating much benefit in terms of lower crime rates.",Crime rates have decreased partly due to the expansion of the U.S. criminal justice system and changes in sentencing practices in the 1980s.,question,1062,140.0

Behavioral and emotional problems comprising internalizing, externalizing and mixed disorders consist of psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescents. Prevalence rates of 8.3% for preschoolers, 12.2% for preadolescents and 15.0% for adolescents have been reported from around the world. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of emotional and behavioral disorders in 7-11 year-old school children studying in Kandy District Sri Lanka which was a first for the geographic area.


METHOD
This was a community based study at the primary section of the selected schools. The questionnaire, Child behavior Checklist-Sinhala (CBCL-S) was administered in a group setting to the main caregiver of 562 subjects selected randomly. The questionnaire identified problems in 8 subscales under three main sub categories : internalizing, externalizing and other. Data were analyzed using The Syndrome Scales for Boys and Girls developed for analyzing the questionnaire CBCL.


RESULTS
Indicated a prevalence of 13.8% of emotional and behavioral problems in the study population. 8.8% of children showed internalizing problems and 8.8% externalizing problems. These findings are in line with the prevailing rates from previous studies of the world. Children in school types 1AB and 1C had less emotional and behavioral problems compared to type 2 and 3 schools.

Poverty reduction policies that were based on the overly simplistic assumption that expanding economic growth would reduce poverty have not always proved to be correct (KIT Factsheet, 2007). From an estimated one billion people that live on less than US$1 a day (UNDP, 2003), 70 per cent are women (Barrientos, 2002: 1). On top of that, female earnings are approximately 70 to 80 per cent that of male earnings in both developed and developing countries. Only 20 per cent of this difference can be explained by conventional economic variables such as educational attainment, work experience, and job characteristics (Kabeer, 2003). According to Oxfam (2004) this is one of the glaring failures of the current economic model. Millions of women in paid employment contribute significantly to national economic growth, but their jobs do not provide the income, security, and support to lift them and their families out of poverty (Oxfam, 2004: 2).

We have all heard this phrase and know its importance. By 2025, the number of devices based on the fifth generation of mobile networks will reach about 100 billion devices. By then, about 2.5 billion users are expected to consume more than a gigabyte of streamed data per month. 5G will play important roles in a variety of new areas, from smart homes and cars to smart cities, virtual reality and mobile augmented reality, and 4K video streaming. Bandwidth much higher than the fourth generation, more reliability and less latency are some of the features that distinguish this generation of mobile networks from previous generations. Clearly, at first glance, these features may seem very impressive and useful to a mobile network, but these features will pose serious challenges for operators and communications companies. All of these features will lead to considerable complexity. Managing this network, preventing errors, and minimizing latency are some of the challenges that the 5th generation of mobile networks will bring. Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is a good way to solve these challenges. in other say, in such a situation, proper management of the 5G network must be done using powerful tools such as artificial intelligence.

22767,What are the long term effects of ibuprofen?,Chronic toxicity of ibuprofen to Daphnia magna: Effects on life history traits and population dynamics.,"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (IB) is a widely used pharmaceutical that can be found in several freshwater ecosystems. Acute toxicity studies with Daphnia magna suggest that the 48h EC(50) (immobilisation) is 10-100 mgIBl(-1). However, there are currently no chronic IB toxicity data on arthropod populations, and the aquatic life impacts of such analgesic drugs are still undefined. We performed a 14-day exposure of D. magna to IB as a model compound (concentration range: 0, 20, 40 and 80 mgIBl(-1)) measuring chronic effects on life history traits and population performance. Population growth rate was significantly reduced at all IB concentrations, although survival was only affected at 80 mgIBl(-1). Reproduction, however, was affected at lower concentrations of IB (14-day EC(50) of 13.4 mgIBl(-1)), and was completely inhibited at the highest test concentration. The results from this study indicate that the long-term crustacean population consequences of a chronic IB exposure at environmentally realistic concentrations (ngl(-1) to microgl(-1)) would most likely be of minor importance. We discuss our results in relation to recent genomic studies, which suggest that the potential mechanism of toxicity in Daphnia is similar to the mode of action in mammals, where IB inhibits eicosanoid biosynthesis.",Chronic ibuprofen exposure at environmentally realistic concentrations has minor effects on crustacean population growth rate and reproduction.,question,1344,143.0

The literature includes considerable discussion on the etymological origins of individual infinitive endings, but little on intermediate developments which may account for the disparate systems of the historical languages. This paper suggests that at least two separate classes of infinitives are to be noted among the infinitive types which occur cross-dialectally, and that these two classes reflect chronologically distinct occurrences in the history of IE infinitival development. This distinction is most clearly demonstrable in Vedic, but parallel evidence exists in several other dialects.*","Two separate classes of infinitives exist in Indo-European languages, with Vedic showing a clear distinction between them.",question,769,122.0

16950,does insulin regulate bile acid transporters?,Insulin-stimulated bile formation in cats.,"The effects of insulin on bile flow and composition were examined in fasting, chloralose-anesthetized cats. Insulin in doses from 0.01 to 2.00 U/kg increased bile flow and biliary erythritol clearance without any detectable change in the difference between them; thus insulin presumably had no effect on ductular fluid transport. Continuous infusion of insulin (0.8 U/kg+0.05 U/kg/min or 0.05 U/kg+0.002 U/kg/min) increased biliary erythritol clearance by 22%. The increase was caused by a rise in the bile acid-independent fraction of bile production and accompanied by a parallel increase in the rates of biliary excretion of Na+ and Cl-. When ouabain, 80 micrograms/kg, was injected intraportally during insulin infusion the erythritol clearance, bile flow and the rates of biliary excretion of Na+ and Cl- were lowered towards but not to their preinsulin levels. The effects of insulin on these parameters were unchanged after atropin or gastrectomy and 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose was without effect on bile production.

Novel methods to detect tumors as early as possible are desperately needed. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults using abdominal palpation, ultrasonography, or serologic markers. The evidence for diet-based prevention of pancreatic cancer is limited and conflicting. Recommendations about lifestyle changes, such as stopping the use of tobacco products, moderating alcohol intake, and eating a balanced diet with sufficient fruit and vegetables is generally made. However, screening for persons with hereditary predisposition to develop pancreatic cancer has not been included in this review. Biomarkers represent one tool for the early detection of small, surgically resectable cancers in both the general and high risk populations.

3458,why audiencies are avoiding the news?,All the News That’s Fit to Ignore,"In a fragmented digital media environment where news is increasingly encountered passively in social media feeds and via automated mobile alerts, active avoidance of news, rather than deliberate consumption, takes on outsized importance in shaping what it means to be an informed citizen. This article systematically evaluates the factors that predict news avoidance behaviors, considering both individual- and country-level explanations. Using a large-scale quantitative, comparative approach, we examine more than 67,000 survey respondents across 35 countries worldwide and find consistent evidence for how factors including demographics, political attitudes, and news genre preferences shape avoidance consistently across information environments. But we also show how country-level contextual factors, what we call “cultures of news consumption,” influence behaviors beyond that which is explained by respondent-level differences. Specifically, levels of press freedom and political freedom and stability are shown to negatively predict rates of news avoidance. These findings suggest that many people’s news use practices depend not only on personal characteristics and preferences but quite sensibly on the news available to them, which they may have good reason to view as deficient or untrustworthy, as well as culturally specific norms around its value and utility.","Factors like demographics, political attitudes, news genre preferences, press freedom, and political freedom and stability influence news avoidance behaviors.",question,1374,158.0
9962,does teeth brushing help sleep better,Impact of Different Bedtime Oral Cleaning Methods on Dental-Damaging Microbiota Levels,"Introduction: Bedtime teeth cleaning is strongly recommended to limit overnight oral bacterial growth, but the impact of different cleaning methods on oral microbiota remains to be determined. Here we evaluated the efficiency of three oral cleaning methods in decreasing distinct subtypes of dental-damaging bacteria (DDB) using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and 16s-based taxonomic profiling. Materials and Methods: This was a randomized, controlled study of 58 healthy subjects who performed three timed oral cleaning methods for two consecutive nights: tooth brushing with sodium fluoride-containing toothpaste followed by tongue cleaning (BT); cleaning of gums and teeth by rubbing with an index finger followed by tongue cleaning (GIFT); and GIFT with the addition of rice husk activated charcoal (CT). Saliva samples were collected the following morning for qPCR and metagenomics analysis. Results: All three oral cleaning methods resulted in a significant decrease (P < 0.006) in the quantity of DDB compared with no cleaning (NC) controls. Bonferroni post hoc analysis showed that GIFT and CT decreased Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans levels compared to the BT method (P < 0.005). Metagenomics data also showed a more significant decrease in many pathogenic bacteria using the GIFT and CT methods compared to the BT method. Conclusion: BT and GIFT are effective oral cleaning methods and reduce DDB levels. The greater flexibility of a finger to reach all areas of the teeth, gums, and inner cheeks that are inaccessible to a toothbrush to disturb biofilms makes GIFT a better method than traditional toothbrushing for bedtime oral cleaning.",Bedtime teeth cleaning methods like tooth brushing and GIFT reduce dental-damaging bacteria levels..,question,1684,100.0

At the same time, there has been recent work on tourism where it is complementary to aid in improving welfare. By combining these two strands, this paper concentrates on wage inequality in developing countries. We find that an increase in aid in the form of tied aid can lower the relative price of nontraded goods. The rent extracted from tourists declines, reducing welfare of domestic residents. In addition, the fall in the nontradable price can widen the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Thus, increased foreign aid may have detrimental effects on national welfare and the distribution of income. Rising wage inequality is confirmed by numerical simulations.","Increased foreign aid may have detrimental effects on national welfare and the distribution of income, potentially widening wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.",question,826,178.0
15460,why is homosexuality forbidden in islam?,Reinterpreting Usul al-fiqh: Taking a Literary Approach to Prohibitions against Homosexuality in the Qur’an,"In just a few decades, homosexuality has gone from a condemned criminal practice to a protected status. Each individual now has a recognized human right to be free from discrimination on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. Still, homosexuality remains a crime in many Muslim countries. Some even impose capital punishment for the act, using Islamic law to justify this. Jurists derive Islamic law (fiqh) from interpretations of two revealed sources of law – the Qur’an and the Sunna – through a set methodology termed usul al-fiqh. The prohibition against homosexuality largely (and often exclusively) stems from literalist, inflexible interpretations of the narrative of Prophet Lot in the Qur’an. The Egyptian scholar Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd sought to reform contemporary usul al-fiqh by integrating literary analyses in legal exegesis. A literary approach allows the mujtahid or mujtahidda to decipher the purpose of the law. Knowing this, Abu Zayd argued, he or she can adapt the letter of the law to suit its overarching objective keeping in mind evolving norms and modern standards. Yet, Abu Zayd did not fully flesh out what a literary approach to usul al-fiqh would look like in practice. This paper begins to do that by applying such an approach to the prohibition against homosexuality. In fact, a literary analysis of the text suggests that the narrative does not proscribe homosexuality at all. The specific crime of the people of Lot remains ambiguous even though a ban on egotistical immorality and impurity is apparent.","A literary analysis of the Qur'an's narrative of Prophet Lot suggests that it does not explicitly proscribe homosexuality, but rather condemns egotistical immorality and impurity.",question,1538,179.0
21236,what are the barriers to dentists adopting hypnosis into their practice,Hypnosis called effective for dentally handicapped.,"Hypnosis was recommended Tuesday as an effective psychological method to increase the comfort of the ""dentally handicapped"" patient. Dr. Kenneth A. Bartlett, Jr. of Montclair, N. J., said hypnosis has helped in treating extremely nervous and apprehensive patients who ""can truly be classified as dentally handicapped."" In almost all of these cases the traumatic cause was not physical but psychological. Addressing the ADA scientific session, he pointed out that there are two kinds of hypnosis which can be applied in dentistry. One is an informal spontaneous type which is really controlled relaxation and a good interpersonal relationship between dentist and patient. The other kind is formal hypnosis which should only be practiced by dentists who have had formal training in this field, he cautioned. ""If we are aware of the psychological importance of dental care, if we are treating people and not teeth, some form of trance is likely to occur in 90 per cent of our patients. I call this need hypnosis. It is a controlled chairside manner and it is something more. ""A more interpersonal relationship with our patients is, in itself, hypnotic. Let us consider the definition of good interpersonal relationship to be the attitude of trust, confidence, friendship and respect developed in the patient by the doctor. Since it is interpersonal, it calls also for a respect for the needs and feelings of the patient and an appreciation of him as a person,"" he stated. ""Hypnosis is an art, clouded with mysticism and confused with gross misinformation,"" he explained. ""The popular concept of hypnosis in which the operator completely dominates the subject, has almost no place in professional practice. As we begin to apply hypnosis we soon learn that we are dealing not with black magic but with the psychology of the dental situation and the dental patient."" In discussing formal hypnotic utilization technics in the dental practice, Dr. Bartlett said ""all of the technics we use to motivate people at an everyday conscious level such as authority, permissiveness, persuasion, reason, seduction, startle, confusion and blackmail are also the basis of hypnotic induction technics."" He added: ""By the same token all of the approaches we use in formal hypnosis to utilize the trance state, such as relaxation dissociation, altered physiological function and distraction are available to us in the routine treatment of our patients. ""In formal hypnosis the suggestions may be somewhat different, but the results are very much the same. In formal hypnosis we attempt to produce relaxation because it is far more difficult to be hurt if one is relaxed,"" he said.

10047,is black matter real?,Primordial black holes could hold the key to dark matter mysteries,"As far back as the 1930s, astronomers began to suspect that every galaxy and every cluster of galaxies was surrounded by a massive haze of “dark matter”—an utterly invisible ectoplasm that held these photogenic yet fragile structures together with the stabilizing force of its gravity. These early observers were right: Not only does dark matter seem to be real, but it outweighs the visible universe—meaning stars, planets, nebulae, galaxies, and anything else made of ordinary atoms—by a factor of five (1). Yet the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology. One favored theory is that it’s made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that barely interact with normal matter, except gravitationally. Also popular is a theory that dark matter is made of lighter but equally hypothetical particles called axions. But over the past half-decade or so, some researchers have become more open to an older idea: Dark matter consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) that emerged from the Big Bang. “If you’d asked me in the early days I would have said primordial black holes are interesting, but there’s maybe only a 10% chance they really exist,” says Bernard Carr, a physicist at Queen Mary University of London, UK. Carr is referring to the early 1970s, when he and his thesis advisor, the late Stephen Hawking, did the first detailed calculations for how the infant universe could have produced black holes, which are gravitational singularities in which the fabric of space and time curves in on itself so tightly that not even light can escape (2–5). But today, says Carr, who recently coauthored a recent review of PBHs as dark matter (6), “I would bet you at least 50% that they exist, maybe even more.” Carr cheerfully admits that a PBH pioneer like himself is hardly a neutral observer on this subject—and he is quick to acknowledge that PBH formation requires a fine-tuning of cosmological parameters that many researchers find implausible. Still, his cautious optimism can also be heard from other cosmologists. They point to three primary reasons for the shift: first, attempts to find WIMPs or the other hypothesized dark matter particles have come up empty; second, results from gravitational wave experiments looking for ripples in spacetime are surprisingly consistent with the PBH idea. And third, the next decade or two could bring observational evidence that either confirms the existence of PBH dark matter or rules it out.","Dark matter outweighs the visible universe by a factor of five, and primordial black holes (PBHs) are a potential explanation for its existence.",question,2479,144.0

17152,the effects of high lipid concentration in yeast during sake fermentation,Effect of cellular inositol content on ethanol tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in sake brewing.,"The effect of cellular inositol content on the ethanol tolerance of sake yeast was investigated. In a static culture of strain K901 in a synthetic medium, when cells were grown in the presence of inositol in limited amount (L-cells), the inositol content of cells decreased by one-third that of cells grown in the presence of inositol in sufficient amount (H-cells). L-cells exhibited a higher death rate constant than H-cells in the presence of 12-20% ethanol, while no difference in specific ethanol production rate in the presence of 0-18% ethanol between the two cell types was observed. L-cells leaked more intracellular components, such as nucleotides, phosphate and potassium, in the presence of ethanol than H-cells. L-cells exhibited a lower intracellular pH value than H-cells, which represented the lowering of cell vitality by the decrease in H(+) extrusion activity. Furthermore, the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity of L-cells was approximately one-half of that of H-cells. Therefore, it was considered that the decrease in viability in the presence of ethanol due to inositol limitation results from the lowering of H(+)-ATPase activity, which maintains the permeability barrier of the yeast membrane, ensuring the homeostasis of ions in the cytoplasm of yeast cells. It is assumed that the lowering of H(+)-ATPase activity due to inositol limitation is caused by the change in lipid environment of the enzyme, which is affected by inositol-containing glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol (PI), because in the PI-saturated mixed micellar assay system, the difference in H(+)-ATPase activity between L- and H-cells disappeared. In the early stage of sake mash, inositol limitation lowers the ethanol tolerance due to the decrease in H(+)-ATPase activity as in static culture. In the final stage of sake mash, the disruption of the ino1 gene responsible for inositol synthesis, resulted in a decrease in cell density. Furthermore, the ino1 disruptant, which was not capable of increasing the cellular inositol level in the final stage, exhibited a significantly higher methylene blue-staining ratio than the parental strain. It was suggested that the yeast cellular inositol level is one of the important factors which contribute to the high ethanol tolerance implied by the increased cell viability in the presence of ethanol.","Inositol limitation lowers ethanol tolerance in sake yeast due to a decrease in H(+)-ATPase activity, affecting yeast cell viability in the presence of ethanol.",phrase,2357,160.0

It was hypothesized that the intervention would decrease pain anxiety, intensity and interference, fear of movement, and increase pain self-efficacy for a group of self-referred people with arthritis. The intervention consisted of four once-weekly programmes which included animated guides, audio guided mindfulness exercises and a gratitude programme. One hundred and fifty-one people enrolled in the study. Data from 81 people who completed the trial and questionnaires was analysed. Pain anxiety, pain interference, pain intensity, fear of movement and pain self-efficacy were all improved by the intervention as hypothesized. This pilot study lends support to both gratitude and mindfulness being appropriate interventions for physical health conditions and demonstrates how they can be used in combination. Additionally, this shows the potential of online delivery for positive health interventions.","The online mindfulness and gratitude intervention decreased pain anxiety, intensity, and interference, and increased pain self-efficacy in people with arthritis.",question,1026,161.0
19170,what are the benefits of digital government?,Digital Transformation and Knowledge Management in the Public Sector,"Digitizing public services is, at the moment, an essential necessity for numerous governments around the world. An improved government through digitization will not only have a growing effect on businesses, but it will also be able to intensify citizen engagement and push for economic growth. During the last 10 years more countries have progressively begun to provide digital services to their citizens. Therefore, in order to address this development, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the digital government literature in order to describe the aspects of digital transformation in the public sector and how it is related to knowledge management. In this study the methodology is quantitative and it is based on a review and a survey made with the main goal being the estimation from several collected data on how the digital transformation process in the Public Administration takes place and what its relationship is with knowledge management. The review study is based on articles found on Scopus database and it addresses the role that digital government research plays in the theory and practice of knowledge management. In the survey study, 54 employees working for the services of the two governmental areas of the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment were surveyed. The results show that the research on the theme is still at an exploratory stage due to the lack of studies relating digital government to knowledge management effectiveness in the public sector. The results also show that the success of digital government seems to be related with the quality of the organizations’ knowledge management, complementing each other for significant improvements in the public sector. In terms of originality, this study aims to contribute and stimulate data-driven discussions regarding the impacts of the digital transformation in the public sector and their relation with the implementation of knowledge management practices. The results offer insights into future research needs.","Digital government can intensify citizen engagement, push for economic growth, and its success is related to the quality of organizations' knowledge management.",question,2014,160.0
6534,what are the benefits of leadership in organisation,Leadership and Organizational Hierarchies,"Organizations are hierarchies with leaders at the top. Why do we have leaders instead of an algorithm making decisions? The theory of the firm recognizes benefits to centralizing authority but these organizational benefits from hierarchy have not been clearly separated from the specific contributions of leaders. We define leadership as the ability to successfully manage agency and coordination costs created by the purpose of a given organization. The balance between these two types of costs depends on the purpose of the organization and determines the traits relevant for effective leadership. We develop hypotheses about the role of leadership across organizations. We test our hypotheses with data on Soccer Managers in Brazil, NFL coaches, and Deans of Business and Law Schools. Consistent with our hypotheses we find that leadership and changing leaders matters more in sports teams than for Deans.","Leadership effectively manages agency and coordination costs, which are crucial for the success of an organization.",question,908,115.0
21580,how to lose weight,A Mindfulness-Based Health Wellness Program for Managing Morbid Obesity,"There are numerous methods for reducing obesity; however, often none of these methods prove effective for specific individuals. For individuals who have failed on specific diets and other weight loss programs, finding a good match between their needs and an effective method is often difficult. The authors collaboratively developed a multicomponent mindfulness-based health wellness program with an individual who was morbidly obese and wanted a lifestyle change. The components included physical exercise, a food awareness program, mindful eating to manage rapid eating, visualizing and labeling hunger, and a mindfulness procedure as a self-control strategy. The individual reduced his weight from 315 pounds to 171 pounds, increased his physical activity, ate healthy foods, stopped eating rapidly, substantially reduced serious medical risk factors, eliminated physical discomfort and mobility problems due to his weight, and enhanced his lifestyle over almost a 5-year period.

Especially, we investigate the possibility of estimating the acoustic emission by analysis of PIV data. Such a possibility is appealing, since it would allow to directly relate the flow behavior to the aerodynamic noise production. This will help considerably in understanding the noise production mechanisms and to investigate the possible ways of reducing it. In this study, we consider an open cavity with an aspect ratio between its length and depth of 2 at a Reynolds number of 2.4 × 104 and 3.0 × 104 based on the cavity length. The study is carried out combining high speed two-dimensional PIV, wall pressure measurements and sound measurements. The pressure field is computed from the PIV data. Curle’s analogy is applied to obtain the acoustic pressure field. The pressure measurements on the wall of the cavity and the sound measurements are then used to validate the results obtained from PIV and check the range of validity of this approach. This study demonstrated that the technique is able to quantify the acoustic emissions from the cavity and is promising especially for capturing the tonal components on the sound emission.",Estimating acoustic emissions from PIV data can help understand noise production mechanisms and investigate ways to reduce aerodynamic noise.,question,1227,141.0
8378,does production of hyaluronic acid decrease with age?,Effect of Ferulic Acid Isolated from Cnidium Officinale on the Synthesis of Hyaluronic Acid,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of the major extracellular matrix components in skin. The HA content is reportedto decline with age, which may contribute to decrease in skin moisture, wrinkle formation and the decrease in elasticityof the skin. Among the family of HA synthase genes (HAS-1, 2, 3) identified so far, HAS-2 plays crucial roles inthe regulation of HA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts. In this study, we elucidated the effects of ferulic acid isolatedfrom Cnidium officinale on HA production. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR showed that ferulicacid increased mRNA level of HAS-2 gene and ELISA assay also revealed that ferulic acid increased HA productionin human skin fibroblasts. Our study suggests that ferulic acid might prevent age-dependent skin deteriorations suchas wrinkles, dryness and elasticity decrease, all of which could be ascribed to the reduction of the HA content in humanskin.","The HA content declines with age, contributing to decreased skin moisture, wrinkle formation, and reduced skin elasticity.",question,932,122.0
3495,effects of parental involvement on students academic performance,Analysis of secondary school students’ academic performance and parental involvement in children education at home,"Introduction. Parental involvement in children’s education means engagement and participation of parents in the educational activities of their children. The existing body of empirical research shows that parental involvement can influence academic performance of their children in two distinct ways, i.e. parental involvement in children education at home (helping children in homework and other academic discussions, etc.) and parental involvement in children education at school (participation in school function and meetings, etc.). Active involvement of parents in children’s education may even counterbalance the unfavourable effects of low socioeconomic status and underprivileged neighborhood. The overall effect of parental involvement in child education both at home and at school is a worthy source of improving the academic performance of children through securing higher grades at school.Aim. This research aimed to examine the effects of parental involvement in children education at home on academic performance of secondary schools students and to identify the difference of the effects of parental involvement on students of different gender, parent literacy status and parent importance to children education.Methodology and research methods. Cross sectional and a multistage stratified sampling technique was adopted to portray information from sample of 448 students on Likert scale. Chi square, Kendall’s Tau-c tests and Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the level, direction and strength of association among variables.Results. The results showed that the association of children academic performance was significant and positive when parents helped children with their homework (P = 0.000, Tc = 0.231), discussed school progress with children (P = 0.002, Tc = 0.122) and motivated children to work harder when they make a poor grade (P = 0.015, Tc = 0.133). Moreover, the results highlighted variation in the academic performance of children with respect to their gender, parental literacy status, parental importance to children education and parental involvement in children education at home. It was concluded that boys, children of literate parents, children whose parents give more importance to their education and their parents remain involved in their educational activities at home secured higher grades.Scientific novelty. The present study is distinctive in that it examined variations in children’s academic performance with respect to student gender, parental literacy status, and parental importance to their education in addition to focusing on the relationship between parental involvement in their children education at home and academic performance.Practical significance. The analysis of the research outcomes leads to several interesting results and proposes helpful suggestions for important stakeholders. The main study recommendations that will enable parents to promptly meet the educational demands of their children in order to aid them in getting better grades include awareness-raising campaigns for parents, income creation chances for disadvantaged families, and adult literacy initiatives.","Parental involvement in children's education at home, such as helping with homework and discussing school progress, has a significant and positive effect on students' academic performance.",phrase,3161,188.0
15916,which oil is good for health? coconut oil or palm oil?,Quantitative Assessment of Adulteration and Reuse of Coconut Oil Using Transmittance Multispectral Imaging,"Coconut oil known for its wide range of uses is often adulterated with other edible oils. Repeated use of coconut oil in food preparation could lead to many health issues. Existing methods available for evaluating quality of oil are laborious and time consuming. Therefore, we propose an imaging system hardware and image processing-based algorithm to estimate the adulteration of coconut oil with palm oil as the adulterant. A clear functional relationship between adulteration level and Bhattacharyya distance was observed as R2 = 0.9876 on the training samples. Thereafter, another algorithm is proposed to develop a spectral-clustering based classifier to determine the effect of reheat and reuse of coconut oil. Distinct clusters were obtained for different levels of reheated oil classes and the classification was performed with an accuracy of 0.983 on training samples. Further, the input images for the proposed algorithms were generated using an in-house developed transmittance based multispectral imaging system.","Coconut oil is often adulterated with palm oil, and repeated use in food preparation can lead to health issues.",question,1024,111.0

20650,can cbt help with night terrors?,Adult night terrors and paroxetine,"Although rare, night terrors are difficult to treat and a major management problem, especially when accompanied by sleepwalking or other automatic behaviours. Severe injury (sometimes death) during the period of confusion following the rise from bed has been reported, and more frequent attacks lead to serious disruption of sleep, which may impair subsequent daytime functioning and result in psychiatric comorbidity. Night terrors can thus cause severe disability, and effective therapy would be of benefit to patients and their families. There have been reports of treatment with benzodiazepines, imipramine, and longterm psychotherapy, but only benzodiazepines have shown any notable success. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have antipanic actions and there is some overlap in symptoms of nocturnal panic attacks and night terrors. We report a series of six patients with night terrors, referred for drug treatment because of distressing or dangerous accompanying behaviours, or sleep disruption. All six patients were assessed clinically and by home polysomnography (medilog). All responded to treatment with the SSRI paroxetine (table). In these patients paroxetine was effective in the treatment of longstanding and disabling night terrors and may be as effective as benzodiazepines, although formal comparison is necessary. Two of our patients were having terrors while on benzodiazepines, possibly because of the development of tolerance which does not occur with paroxetine. Other advantages of paroxetine over benzodiazepines is that it treats comorbid or secondary depression and is not a drug of abuse. We suggest that the terror-suppressing action of paroxetine is a direct effect of its ability to increase 5hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations in the brainstem by blocking reuptake. Terror-like behaviour in animals and man can be readily provoked by stimulation of the periaqueductal grey matter, and this behaviour in animals is suppressed by acute administration of SSRIs and direct-acting 5HT2c receptor agonists. 5HT2c agonists are in clinical development for the treatment of anxiety and depression and it would be interesting to test their efficacy in night terrors. The effects of paroxetine on sleep are known and probably do not contribute to its effect on night terrors. Further evidence that the therapeutic action of paroxetine may be direct rather than through a neuroadaptive mechanism (thought to underlie the antipanic action) comes from the patients who had relapse after stopping treatment. Night terrors recurred rapidly as plasma and brain concentrations of paroxetine fell, and restarting treatment quickly suppressed them again. In one patient the treatment effect seemed dose related. The two cases previously reported to have responded to imipramine also responded rapidly, suggesting a different mode of action to the antidepressant effect. Imipramine also has 5-HT-uptake blocking effects. We found paroxetine to be a safe and effective treatment for disabling night terrors in a small group of patients. The effectiveness of such a selective agent as paroxetine may also suggest a role for decreased central 5-HT function in the aetiology of night terrors.","Paroxetine, an SSRI, was found to be effective in treating disabling night terrors in a small group of patients.",question,3219,112.0

13273,what impact does diet have on libido?,The Orgasmic Diet: boost your libido and achieve orgasm,"My initial reaction to this book was one of excited anticipation, the title grabbed my attention from the outset and it had the same effect on nearly every woman I mentioned it to! Interestingly, my experience of reading the book seemed to follow the ebb and flow of female sexual arousal: sometimes I felt interested and absorbed, other times critical and disengaged. The book contains a revolutionary plan to lift your libido and bring you to orgasm. The author claims that ‘this book gives all women the ability to have orgasms within two weeks, even if they have never had one before’. And how is this miracle achieved? Well . . . it’s through a combination of diet, exercise and nutritional supplements. According to Lindberg, ‘the only aspect of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) not addressed by the orgasmic diet is pain with intercourse’. These are remarkable claims and ones that those working with women who experience sexual problems will need to consider, discuss and debate. Dr David Ferguson, who comments that the author has developed a programme of diet and exercise that alleviates the suppression of sexual response suffered by far too many women, gives the foreword. He also reports that they have tried to get the authors programme into a well-controlled clinical trial but so far they have been unable to find a sponsor to fund one. According to Dr Ferguson, this is due to the fact that the diet cannot be patented and is therefore of little commercial interest, with the result that much of the ‘evidence’ is based on case histories. With no ‘evidence-based’ research the book contains a disclaimer by the author and publisher expressly denying any responsibility for any adverse effects caused by the diet. It also contains numerous recommendations that women should consult with or at least discuss the information presented in the diet plan with their doctor. I would be interested to know how many general practitioners in the UK would support or be willing or able to offer advice regarding the more controversial aspects of this diet. So what are the main principles of this revolutionary diet plan?","The Orgasmic Diet claims to boost libido and achieve orgasm through a combination of diet, exercise, and nutritional supplements.",question,2127,129.0

10385,is the human mind is separate from the body?,Shared representations in body perception.,"The ability to understand events that happen to other people is a characteristic feature of the human mind. Here, we investigate whether the links between mental representation of one's own body and the bodies of other people could form the basis of human social representations. We studied interpersonal body representation (IBR) in a series of behavioural cueing experiments. Subjects responded to tactile events on their own body after a visual event was presented in either the corresponding anatomical location on a model's body, or in a non-corresponding location. We found that reactions were faster when the visual cue was in register with the tactile stimulation. This effect was absent when identical visual events were presented on a non-body control stimulus, suggesting a body specific mechanism for interpersonal registration of purely sensory events. Similar interpersonal systems have been demonstrated previously for the coding of action and emotion, but we believe that our results provide the first behavioural evidence for interpersonal body representation at the purely sensory level. We show that a sensory processing mechanism specific for bodies is automatically activated when viewing another person. Interpersonal body representation may be an important precursor to empathy and theory of mind. In our social world, we understand the percepts of others by registering them against the representations used to perceive our own body, and this mechanism involves an interpersonal somatotopic map.","Interpersonal body representation (IBR) suggests that we understand the percepts of others by registering them against the representations used to perceive our own body, involving an interpersonal somatotopic map.",question,1519,213.0

Interviews with twelve, mid-level district leaders committed to anti-racism in Ontario, Canada, reveal fundamental differences in leaders’ knowledges and capacities compared to those identified in the literature on educational change and promoted in the corresponding leadership frameworks in Ontario. In centering power, racialization, and whiteness as a logic of oppression, anti-racist approaches to leadership fundamentally reconstitute conceptions and enactments of leadership. Findings speak to the importance of knowledge(s) about race and racialization, racism and intersecting oppressions, and how whiteness subverts anti-racist efforts. Findings also speak to developing capacities such as: visioning that both owns historical injustices and imagines future possibilities; organizing and collectivizing as a means of power sharing and decentering the individual leader; facilitating difficult learning in the face of racist resistance and multiple frameworks; securing accountability for rights by building informal accountability structures while advocating for formal ones; aligning resources and creating structures in support of students from historically oppressed communities; and, sustaining the self in the face of the impending harm in doing this work. With a focus on whiteness, this study invites scholars and practitioners to turn the gaze upward and consider what might need to be undone and unlearned from multiple and intersecting systems of oppression, what the authors refer to as unleading.","Ontario's mid-level district leaders committed to anti-racism reveal differences in knowledge and capacities, highlighting the importance of addressing race, racialization, and whiteness in the education system.",question,1786,211.0

The half-life for degradation of the mixed muscle proteins was determined from the change in total hind leg radioactivity between 2 and 7 days following an intravenous injection of 4-MC-aspartic acid. From these data and the size of the hind leg muscle protein pool, the rate of muscle protein synthesis was calcu lated. The prolonged protein-depletion phase resulted in loss of body weight, in crease in the water, chloride and DNA concentrations and a decrease in lipid and RNA in muscle. Refeeding rapidly reversed these changes. The half-life for catabolism of mixed proteins in muscle of depleted rats was 10.2 days as com pared (P > 0.1) with a value of 13.1 days for well-nourished weight-control rats (74 g). During the first 9 days of refeeding, the synthesis of mixed muscle pro teins proceeded at a greater rate (P < 0.01) than in the weight control rats. In contrast, the catabolism of muscle protein was abolished during this period. After 2 months of refeeding, the half-life for catabolism of mixed muscle proteins was 12.6 days.

Expected level of quality is influenced by customer perception of quality, which in turn is impacted by external and internal factors. In service industries, the interaction between the service provider and the customer may also influence quality. Thus quality may consist of tangible and intangible factors. In this chapter we consider the measurable attributes associated with quality in the service sector.

11790,does obesity spread through social networks?,"Differences by degree: Fatness, contagion and pre-emption","Drawing on evidence from the Framingham Heart Study, Christakis and Fowler in their 2007 article published in the New England Journal of Medicine make the claim that obesity spreads in social networks. Whether they are correct in this assertion is neither the concern nor focus of this article. Rather, what is of interest is the subsequent mobilisation of ‘contagion’ to describe this spread and to account for the emergence of an ‘obesity epidemic’ in contemporary society. Contrary to the argument that there is less stigma attached to obesity, the reporting of the Christakis and Fowler article suggests that being ‘fat’ remains a signifier of moral and physical decay; if we add to this the suggestion that obesity is spread within social networks, it is possible that the stigma associated with body size will begin to mirror that which is attached to other infectious bodies. In order to consider the potential implications of this, the article develops in three directions: it explores the application of contagion as a metaphor for understanding the spread of obesity; it sets this understanding within the context of scholarship on contagion and it draws on critical obesity studies literature to call for a more cautionary approach to be taken when deploying a term that when combined with pre-emptive public health discourse would add significantly to the pathologising of the corpulent, fat or obese body.","Obesity is described as spreading in social networks, potentially increasing the stigma associated with body size.",question,1418,114.0
14181,does movies helps in understanding history,Developing Historical Competency: Teaching German History Through History Films At University Putra Malaysia (BA German Programme),"History films personalize, dramatize and emotionalize historical events and characters. They revive the past by exemplifying it in the present, engage ongoing discourses of history and as a result have proven to be the most influential medium in conveying history to large audiences. History films are regarded as an attractive, motivating and efficient (supplementary) teaching and learning medium in history as well as in foreign language classes. As part of the course “Historical Survey of Germany” (BA German-programme at University Putra Malaysia) history film projects on important periods and events in German history were conducted. The article introduces a film project on World War II and describes the pedagogical approach which aims to develop three core competencies of historical understanding – Content Knowledge, Historical Empathy/Perspective Recognition and Narrative Analysis. It discusses selected general findings provided as qualitative data in group and individual assignments. While the responses to questions related to Content Knowledge and Narrative Analysis show that students achieved higher competency levels, the participants showed shortcomings in the rational examination of historical characters, their perspectives and motivations for their actions. Time, practice and guidance can be identified as key factors in developing historical literacy competencies further.","History films can be an efficient supplementary teaching and learning medium, helping develop content knowledge and narrative analysis in students.",question,1402,147.0
1914,Does social media create insomnia?,"Prevalence of Insomnia and Its Association with Social Media Usage among University Students in Selangor, Malaysia, 2018","Insomnia is an arising common health problem in Malaysia. There are many factors contributed to insomnia in young adults but very few are known. Increasing usage of social media may be one of the contributing factors to insomnia along its association with the sociodemographic factors. The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of insomnia and to study its association with usage of social media and sociodemographic factors among university students. A cross-sectional based questionnaire was conducted among 445 students aged 18-30 years old in a private university in Selangor from July to August 2018. The questionnaire consisted of three parts to assess insomnia, social media usage and some socio-demographic factors. The age of the respondents ranged from 19 to 33 years old and the majority was relatable to insomnia (69%). The frequency of accessing social media was significantly associated with insomnia (p value=0.005). The time of the day of accessing social media mostly was significantly associated as well with insomnia, especially evening (p value=0.02), night time (p value=0.01) and before sleeping time (p value=0.04). The use of gadgets (phones/laptops/tablets) before sleeping at night also showed significant association with insomnia (p value=0.003). The sociodemographic factors (gender, age, race, income, relationship and living status) showed no significant association with insomnia. As a conclusion, the most influential factors that significantly associated to insomnia among students in a private university were the frequency of accessing social media, time of social media usage (the evening, night and before sleeping), and the usage of gadgets before sleeing on bed.","The frequency of accessing social media, time of social media usage (evening, night, and before sleeping), and using gadgets before bed are significantly associated with insomnia among university students.",question,1718,205.0

12916,are covid-19 vaccination program effective?,Scientific and Ethical Principles Underlying Recommendations From the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for COVID-19 Vaccination Implementation.,"The continued global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the pressing need for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine development efforts of unprecedented scale and speed are being pursued. Since June 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has held 4 public meetings to lay the groundwork for public health recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. This Viewpoint summarizes the approach ACIP is taking in formulating recommendations, with a focus on the ethical principles and potential groups for allocation of vaccine doses when supply is limited. Recommendations will be issued after reviewing safety and effectiveness data and vaccines are licensed or authorized under Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ACIP is an independent federal advisory committee body composed of experts external to the federal government from diverse medical and public health fields, as well as a consumer representative. The committee is charged with recommending how FDAlicensed or authorized vaccines should be used in the US civilian population.1 These recommendations are provided to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If the CDC director approves the recommendations, they become official CDC recommendations for immunizations in the US. ACIP recommendations determine the vaccines that are covered under the Vaccines for Children program, which provides vaccines at no cost for Medicaid-insured, underinsured, and uninsured children. Under the provisionsoftheAffordableCareAct(ACA),recommendedvaccines are covered by health insurers and employersponsored health plans established after passage of the ACA.1 Hence, while not binding, recommendations determinehowvaccinesareusedinthepublicsectorandsetthe standard for clinical practice in the private sector. ACIP meetings are open to the public and committee documents are publicly available, ensuring transparency in decision-making. The development of recommendations adheres to a rigorous and transparent process. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods facilitate a standardized approach to evaluating scientific evidence.1 The Evidence to Recommendations framework evaluates factors including feasibility and acceptability.1 Hence, the ACIP aims to produce national vaccine recommendations that are both evidence-based and implementable. Implementing COVID-19 vaccination presents a number of unique, interrelated challenges. During its public meetings, the ACIP has characterized guiding principles, assembled and reviewed available data, and summarized considerations for allocation of initial doses. The ACIP is reviewing and incorporating aspects of frameworks and guidance developed by a number of expert panels.2-4 An important additional contribution to this approach is the charge to consider the “on-theground” realities of vaccine program implementation.",ACIP recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination will be issued after reviewing safety and effectiveness data and FDA authorization.,question,2986,129.0
12127,what is relationship between muscle strength and risk of fall in older adults,The risk factors related to falling in elderly females.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between muscle strength and functional mobility and falls in women aged 65 and over. Thirty-one female subjects with a mean age of 69.57 +/- 4.89 years (65-78) were enrolled in the study. Demographic properties, body mass index, comorbid medical conditions, smoking, the number of medications taken, and fall characteristics were recorded. Knee flexor and extensor strength of the dominant extremity was measured by Biodex isokinetic system, and physical capacity was assessed with a 6-minute walk test. Cognitive status was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and disability in daily activities was determined with the Barthel Index. Twelve subjects (38.7%) reported experiencing a fall in the previous year. Eight (25.8%) had experienced a fall outside the home and 4 (12.9%) inside the home. Nine subjects had fallen once, 2 subjects twice, and 1 subject had fallen 3 times. Six (19.4%) subjects reported a fracture after falling. Muscle strength of the knee extensors and flexors and work capacity was similar between those who had fallen and those who had not. The risk factors related to falling were evaluated, but no related factor was determined. Fear of falling was found to be high in patients who had fallen in the previous year. In conclusion, knee extensor and flexor strength are not significant factors in falls or the risk of falling for elderly women, particularly those who are able to function independently. Balance tests in current use are not effective predictors of falls in older adults who live independently and who do not have any significant health problem. These results suggest that there may be a significant interactive effect of the many causal factors that we need to address. Further study is needed to develop new assessment tools for active elderly people to help prevent falls and fall-related injuries.",Knee extensor and flexor strength are not significant factors in falls or the risk of falling for elderly women who can function independently.,question,1912,143.0
20934,Is social media bad for sleep?,The impact of social media volume and addiction on medical student sleep quality and academic performance: A cross-sectional observational study,"Problem Statement: Social media use may be detrimental to sleep quality, self-esteem, and mental health and may affect academic performance in medical students. However, the effects of problematic social media use on sleep quality and academic performance in medical students are unknown. 
Approach: A total of 170 medical students in a Saudi Arabian medical school were studied. The relationships between social media use volume (duration of use per day) and addiction (measured using the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale) of seven platforms and (i) quality of sleep measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and (ii) academic performance according to the grade point average were examined. Caffeine intake was considered as a potential confounder, and data were analyzed using uni- and multi-variable logistic regression. 
Results: Poor quality sleep (72.9% and 63.5% during the week or at the weekend, respectively) and social media addiction (27.1% addicted to three or more platforms) were common. Individuals with high-volume WhatsApp (odds ratio [OR] 1.59 [1.20–2.10], P = 0.001) and Snapchat (OR 1.41 [1.10–1.81], P = 0.007) use were more likely to have very poor sleep quality at the weekend, the latter persisting in multivariable analysis. Students who were addicted to Snapchat (OR 2.53 [1.03–6.22], P = 0.044) or who were addicted to three or more social media platforms (OR 2.93 [1.19–7.23], P = 0.019) had an even greater risk of very poor weekend sleep quality.

18387,can cities effectively predict and prevent risks using machine learning?,Predicting breast cancer risk using personal health data and machine learning models,"Among women, breast cancer is a leading cause of death. Breast cancer risk predictions can inform screening and preventative actions. Previous works found that adding inputs to the widely-used Gail model improved its ability to predict breast cancer risk. However, these models used simple statistical architectures and the additional inputs were derived from costly and / or invasive procedures. By contrast, we developed machine learning models that used highly accessible personal health data to predict five-year breast cancer risk. We created machine learning models using only the Gail model inputs and models using both Gail model inputs and additional personal health data relevant to breast cancer risk. For both sets of inputs, six machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial data set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric quantified each model’s performance. Since this data set has a small percentage of positive breast cancer cases, we also reported sensitivity, specificity, and precision. We used Delong tests (p < 0.05) to compare the testing data set performance of each machine learning model to that of the Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Tool (BCRAT), an implementation of the Gail model. None of the machine learning models with only BCRAT inputs were significantly stronger than the BCRAT. However, the logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and neural network models with the broader set of inputs were all significantly stronger than the BCRAT. These results suggest that relative to the BCRAT, additional easy-to-obtain personal health inputs can improve five-year breast cancer risk prediction. Our models could be used as non-invasive and cost-effective risk stratification tools to increase early breast cancer detection and prevention, motivating both immediate actions like screening and long-term preventative measures such as hormone replacement therapy and chemoprevention.","Machine learning models using additional easy-to-obtain personal health inputs can improve five-year breast cancer risk prediction, potentially aiding in early detection and prevention.",question,2022,185.0

This study aimed to determine the effect of sucralose and aspartame consumption on gut microbiota composition using realistic doses of NNSs. Seventeen healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 45 years who had a body mass index (BMI) of 20–25 were selected. They undertook two 14-day treatment periods separated by a four-week washout period. The sweeteners consumed by each participant consisted of a standardized dose of 14% (0.425 g) of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame and 20% (0.136 g) of the ADI for sucralose. Faecal samples collected before and after treatments were analysed for microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). There were no differences in the median relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial taxa (family and genus) before and after treatments with both NNSs. The microbiota community structure also did not show any obvious differences. There were no differences in faecal SCFAs following the consumption of the NNSs.

13940,does chewing coca leaves affect clotting?,Coca Chewing and High-Altitude Stress: Possible Effects of Coca Alkaloids on Erythropoiesis [and Comments and Reply],"Andean Indians who chew coca seek to alleviate symptoms of hunger, thirst, fatigue, cold, and pain. A complete explanation of coca's use should account for these motives. The distribution of coca chewing in the Andes is shown to parallel that of polycythemia. Coca chewing is more common in higher altitudes, with men consistently chewing more than women and children, and chewing is especially common amongst mineworkers. Since androgens stimulate erythropoiesis and estrogens depress it, men at any given altitude are also more susceptible to polycythemia than women. Mineworkers are polycythemic because of silicosis. The debilitating effects of viscous blood from polycythemia are more consequential than the increased ability of the blood to transport oxygen. Clinical manifestations of polycythemia include fatigue and headache, some of the very symptoms which coca chewers seek to alleviate by their use of the drug. A physiological mechanism is suggested by which cocaine and ecgonine, the active ingredients in the coca leaf, may suppress erythropoiesis, thereby helping to alleviate these symptoms. Since evidence exists that, when nutrition and disease are taken into account as influencing factors, coca chewers have lower hematocrits than controls, it is likely that coca use provides specific medicinal relief for chronic polycythemia.","Coca chewing may suppress erythropoiesis, helping alleviate symptoms of polycythemia, which is associated with viscous blood and fatigue.",question,1349,137.0

Studies have shown that adolescents are using these online spaces to address developmental issues, especially needs for intimacy and connection to others. Online communication with its potential for interacting with unknown others, may put teens at increased risk. Two hundred and fifty-one high school students completed an in-person survey, and 126 of these completed an additional online questionnaire about how and why they use the Internet, their activities on social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace) and their reasons for participation, and how they perceive these online spaces to impact their friendships. To examine the extent of overlap between online and offline friends, participants were asked to list the names of their top interaction partners offline and online (Facebook and instant messaging). Results reveal that adolescents mainly use social networking sites to connect with others, in particular with people known from offline contexts. While adolescents report little monitoring by their parents, there was no evidence that teens are putting themselves at risk by interacting with unknown others. Instead, adolescents seem to use the Internet, especially social networking sites, to connect with known others.

Familiarity with the features of remote monitoring systems and the data supporting its use are vital for physicians’ care for patients with CEIDs. Recent findings Remote monitoring remains underutilized, but its use is expanding including in new practice settings including emergency departments. Patient experience and outcomes are positive, with earlier detection of clinical events such as atrial fibrillation, reductions in inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks and potentially a decrease in mortality with frequent remote monitoring utilizaiton. Rates of hospitalization are reduced among remote monitoring users, and the replacement of outpatient follow-up visits with remote monitoring transmissions has been shown to be well tolerated. In addition, health resource utilization is lower and remote monitoring has been associated with considerable cost savings. A dose relationship exists between use of remote monitoring and patient outcomes, and those with early and high transmission rates have superior outcomes. Summary Remote monitoring provides clinicians with the ability to provide comprehensive follow-up care for patients with CIEDs.

22577,is fishing decreasing the genetic adaptive potential of fish?,Reversal of evolutionary downsizing caused by selective harvest of large fish,"Evolutionary responses to the long-term exploitation of individuals from a population may include reduced growth rate, age at maturation, body size and productivity. Theoretical models suggest that these genetic changes may be slow or impossible to reverse but rigorous empirical evidence is lacking. Here, we provide the first empirical demonstration of a genetically based reversal of fishing-induced evolution. We subjected six populations of silverside fish (Menidia menidia) to three forms of size-selective fishing for five generations, thereby generating twofold differences among populations in mean weight and yield (biomass) at harvest. This was followed by an additional five generations during which size-selective harvest was halted. We found that evolutionary changes were reversible. Populations evolving smaller body size when subjected to size-selective fishing displayed a slow but significant increase in size when fishing ceased. Neither phenotypic variance in size nor juvenile survival was reduced by the initial period of selective fishing, suggesting that sufficient genetic variation remained to allow recovery. By linear extrapolation, we predict full recovery in about 12 generations, although the rate of recovery may taper off near convergence. The recovery rate in any given wild population will also depend on other agents of selection determined by the specifics of life history and environment. By contrast, populations that in the first five generations evolved larger size and yield showed little evidence of reversal. These results show that populations have an intrinsic capacity to recover genetically from harmful evolutionary changes caused by fishing, even without extrinsic factors that reverse the selection gradient. However, harvested species typically have generation times of 3–7 years, so recovery may take decades. Hence, the need to account for evolution in managing fisheries remains.","Fish populations can recover genetically from harmful evolutionary changes caused by fishing when size-selective harvest is halted, but recovery may take decades.",question,1935,162.0
15302,does cbd reduce anxiety?,Sex-dependent differences in the anxiolytic-like effect of cannabidiol in the elevated plus-maze,"Rationale: Cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis, has therapeutic potential for the treatment of anxiety. Most preclinical studies investigate only acute effects of CBD and only in males, yet the drug is most likely to be used over a sustained period in clinical practice. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to investigate the anxiolytic-like effect of CBD in female rats compared to males and to determine whether the responsiveness of females was influenced by the stage of the estrous cycle. Methods: We carried out experiments to compare the effect of CBD in male and female rats in the elevated plus maze (EPM) in response to acute and short-term (4 days) administration through a complete cycle in females. Results: Male and female rats behaved in a similar manner in the EPM, but females in the late diestrus (LD) phase exhibited more anxiety-like behavior than at other stages, the difference reaching statistical significance compared to proestrus stages. CBD produced anxiolytic-like effects in both sexes, but female rats were responsive only in LD and 10-fold lower dose than males. After sub-chronic (4 days) treatment, responsiveness to CBD was maintained in females in LD, but females in proestrus remained unresponsive to CBD treatment. Conclusions: We suggest that there are sex differences in the anxiolytic-like effects of CBD in rats that reflect different underlying mechanisms: based on literature data, gonadal hormone status linked to GABAA receptor expression in females, and 5-HT1A receptor activation in males.","CBD produced anxiolytic-like effects in both male and female rats, but female rats were responsive only in the late diestrus phase and at a 10-fold lower dose than males.",question,1580,170.0

15917,effects of ai in news generation,‘We are a neeeew generation’: Early adolescents’ views on news and news literacy,"To function as well-informed citizens in democracy, early adolescents (12–16 years old) should become news literate news consumers. In this time of fragmented media use and evolving conceptions of (the importance and relevance of) news, this is not easy. Therefore, this focus group study investigated news consumption and news literacy through the eyes of early adolescents. Results showed that early adolescents have broad definitions of news. Their news consumption is predominantly passive, possibly due to a lack of intrinsic motivation. They see news as important, but often as boring, repetitive and negative, and disconnected from youth. Participants had knowledge of news content and effects, and stressed the importance of reliable news. However, for the majority, this did not translate into critical evaluation of news. For early adolescents, the key factor in becoming more news literate news consumers is motivation.

3054,can creatine treat concussions?,Concussions in Ice Hockey — Moving Toward Objective Diagnoses and Point-of-care Treatment: A Review,"While management of concussion must begin with an objective diagnosis, the need for identification and testing of pharmacological concussion treatment options is a priority. Abstract The incidence of sport-related concussion coupled with a doubling of the participation rate in youth hockey over the past two decades provides impetus for the review of the most promising concussion treatment options. This narrative review summarizes the future treatment options for sport-related concussions in ice hockey, while acknowledging their generalizability to concussion in all sports. Symptom assessment, sign observation, as well as cognitive and balance testing, have historically been used to diagnose a concussion. These methods continue to improve, but the need for effective treatments is clear. Pharmacologic, transcranial light, and nutritional supplement treatment options for concussion warranting further investigation have been identified. Dimethyl fumarate is an immunomodulatory compound thought to trigger antioxidant gene expression. Memantine reduces apoptosis and astrogliosis by inhibiting the calcium influx into cells normally caused by glutamate's activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Thioredoxin-mimetic peptides and transcranial photobiomodulation temper the effects of the energy crisis by acting as free radical scavengers. In addition, seven neuroprotective nutritional supplements have been identified: berberine, creatine, curcumin, melatonin, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, and vitamins. An estimated US $1.1 billion has been spent on unsuccessful traumatic brain injury clinical trials. As our ability to accurately diagnose concussion improves, dimethyl fumarate, memantine, thioredoxin-mimetic peptides, transcranial photobiomodulation, and nutritional supplements (berberine, creatine, curcumin, melatonin, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, and vitamins) warrant further preclinical and clinical examination in advancing the treatment of sport-related concussions.",Creatine is identified as one of the nutritional supplements warranting further investigation for potential concussion treatment.,question,2005,129.0
5716,what makes humans happy?,THEORY OF BIOHAPPINESS AND GENETIC VIRTUE OF MARK WALKER,"Mark Walker, one of the ideologists of modern transhumanism, developed a number of neuroethics provisions for the implementation of the “human enhancement” project. The basic elements of “making happy” are neurovirtues mediated by the introduction of genetic engineering (the creation of “happy-people-pills” (HPP)). The methodological basis or norm for genetic engineering is proposed to use the type of hyperthymic people. In the concept, there is some repetition of the ideas of O. Huxley’s novel “Brave New World”, where residents use soma, have the corrected nature of “genetic virtues”, and are in a state of controlled “ignorance”, happiness, and peace. M. Walker formulates his solution to O. Huxley’s dilemma (the choice between happiness and perfection) through the legalization and improvement of HPP. However, the interpretation of happiness itself is not satisfactory for transhumanists, since it comes down solely to neuroreduction and positive arguments for the use of radical technologies, including the programs which launch irreversible processes.","Genetic engineering and ""happy-people-pills"" (HPP) are proposed as methods to make humans happy in Mark Walker's theory of biohappiness.",question,1065,136.0

In this study, 13-month-old mice were used to evaluate the effects of collagen hydrolysates (CHs) from silver carp skin on osteoporosis. No significant differences were observed in mice body weight, spleen or thymus indices after daily intake of antioxidant collagen hydrolysates (ACH; 200 mg/kg body weight (bw) (LACH), 400 mg/kg bw (MACH), 800 mg/kg bw (HACH)), collagenase hydrolyzed collagen hydrolysates (CCH) or proline (400 mg/kg body weight) for eight weeks, respectively. ACH tended to improve bone mineral density, increase bone hydroxyproline content, enhance alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level and reduce tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b) activity in serum, with significant differences observed between the MACH and model groups (p < 0.05). ACH exerted a better effect on osteoporosis than CCH at the identical dose, whereas proline had no significant effect on repairing osteoporosis compared to the model group.

The most frequently used prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor is indomethacin. Fetuses exposed to indomethacin in utero have been born with renal developmental defects, and in both the unborn child and the term and premature newborn this drug may compromise renal glomerular function. The latter has in the past also been observed when i.v. indomethacin or i.v. acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were administered to newborn rabbits. The present experiments were designed to evaluate whether ibuprofen has less renal side effects than indomethacin, as claimed. Three groups of anesthetized, ventilated, normoxemic neonatal rabbits were infused with increasing doses of ibuprofen (0.02, 0.2, 2.0 mg/kg body weight) and the following renal parameters were measured: urine volume, urinary sodium excretion, GFR, and renal plasma flow. Renal blood flow, filtration fraction, and the renal vascular resistance were calculated according to standard formulae. Intravenous ibuprofen caused a dose-dependent, significant reduction in urine volume, GFR, and renal blood flow with a fall in filtration fraction in the animals receiving the highest dose of ibuprofen (2 mg/kg body weight). There was a very steep rise in renal vascular resistance. Urinary sodium excretion decreased. These experiments in neonatal rabbits clearly show that acute i.v. doses of ibuprofen also have significant renal hemodynamic and functional side effects, not less than seen previously with indomethacin.","Acute i.v. doses of ibuprofen can cause significant renal hemodynamic and functional side effects in neonatal rabbits, similar to indomethacin.",question,1651,143.0

The first experiment was conducted using six male lambs at a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design to evaluate diet digestibility and microbial N synthesis according to the level of intake: ad libitum, or restricted to either 70 or 55% of the ad libitum intake. In the second experiment, fifteen male lambs were housed in individual stalls, in a completely randomized design, and fed one of the three levels of dry matter intake (DMI). Chewing patterns were then evaluated for 24 h using a regular 5-min interval observation technique, two times during the experimental period. Decreasing level of feed intake resulted in increased apparent digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fibre, as well as of the true digestibility of organic matter. Total time spent eating and ruminating decreased with feed restriction. However, lambs fed at restricted levels of intake presented a higher rate of eating (g DMI/min) than those fed ad libitum, and spent more time ruminating each gram of DM (min/g DMI).

Many but not all criminological studies have found that immigrants appear to be less involved in crime than natives. Despite such findings, the public continues to believe that immigrants are crime-prone. Anti-immigrant prejudice varies by a country's experience with immigration. Second-generation immigrants tend to be more involved in crime than natives but not everywhere. Research on immigrants and crime is seriously hampered by the lack of data regarding the immigrant status of criminals and victims. Studies indicate that immigrants are primarily the victims of other immigrants for conventional crime. Living in ethnic enclaves tends to protect immigrants from intergroup conflict but exposes them to intragroup conflict. The deportation of immigrants who have committed crimes has contributed to new crime problems in less-developed countries as well as the growth of transnational gangs. The criminalization of immigration policy has provided governments with a means to achieve crime control objectives via immigration rules which do not abide by the traditional safeguards against the unfair use of power or the infliction of excessive punishment.

11889,christianity impact on roman empire,Religion and Authority in Roman Carthage: From Augustus to Constantine,"This book examines the organization of religion in the Roman empire from Augustus to Constantine. Although there have been illuminating particular studies of the relationship between religious activity and socio-political authority in the empire, there has been no large-scale attempt to assess it as a whole. Taking as his focus the situation in Carthage, the greatest city of the western provinces, J.B. Rives argues that the traditional religion, predicated on the structure of a city-state, could not serve to integrate individuals into an empire. In upholding traditional religion, the government abandoned the sort of political control of religious behaviour characteristic of the Roman Republic, and allowed poeple to determine their own religious identities. The importance of Christianity was thus suited to the needs of the increasingly homogeneous Roman empire.","Christianity's importance was suited to the needs of the increasingly homogeneous Roman empire, as traditional religion could not integrate individuals into an empire.",phrase,872,167.0

16935,does remote patient monitoring increase hospital costs?,A Low-cost Adaptable and Personalized Remote Patient Monitoring System,"Remote patient monitoring systems (RMS) have gained increasing popularity in recent years. RMS have great potential to improve medical services by providing more affordable, timely, and accessible care. This paper describes an effective low-cost RMS that is readily deployable. The system targets chronic disease patients and attempts to reduce patient visits to the hospital and healthcare costs. The system is comprised of three modules: (1) an application for data acquisition, processing, and transmission, (2) an adaptable set of ""personalized"" sensors for measuring vitals and reporting emergency situations, and (3) a secure communication module for remote patient-physician interactions. The users interface with the RMS through an application installed on a mobile device.

Amidst the crisis, reports of in vitro inhibitory activity of ivermectin, an approved anthelmintic, against the causative SARSCoV2 virus, have generated lot of optimism. In this article, we have fished and compiled the needed information on the drug, that will help readers and prospective investigators in having a quick overview. Though the primordial biological action of the drug is allosteric modulation of helminthic ion channel receptor, its in vitro activity against both RNA and DNA viruses is known for almost a decade. In the past two years, efficacy study in animal models of pseudorabies and zika virus was found to be favourable and unfavourable respectively. Only one clinical study evaluated the drug in dengue virus infection without any clinical efficacy. However, the proposed mechanism of drug action, by inhibiting the importin family of nucleus-cytoplasmic transporters along with favourable pharmacokinetics, warrants exploration of its role in COVID 19 through safely conducted clinical trials. Being an available and affordable drug, enlisted in WHO List of Essential Medicine, and a long track record of clinical safety, the drug is already in clinical trials the world over.

Mutations in the residues R132 of IDH1 or R172 of IDH2 switch the enzymatic activity towards the production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) at high intracellular concentration. IDH1 and IDH2 are important hubs in the metabolic network and their mutations result in metabolic reprogramming of mutant glioma cells with far-reaching downstream effects such as epigenetic modifications and modulation of immune response that promote cancer. D-2HG has emerged as a versatile and multipurpose biomarker for gliomas to diagnose IDH mutations, for treatment planning, and to monitor response to standard chemoradiation or targeted therapies. Noninvasive imaging of D-2HG based on magnetic resonance spectroscopy is feasible in patients and may enable precision oncology in glioma patients.

6263,how does fluoride affect dental health?,Recent advances in cellular effects of fluoride: an update on its signalling pathway and targeted therapeutic approaches,"Fluoride is a natural element essential in minute quantities in human's to maintain dental and skeletal health. However, the disease fluorosis manifests itself due to excessive fluoride intake mostly through drinking water and sometimes through food. At the cellular energetics level, fluoride is a known inhibitor of glycolysis. At the tissue level, the effect of fluoride has been more pronounced in the musculoskeletal systems due to its ability to retain fluoride. Fluoride alters dentinogenesis, thereby affecting the tooth enamel formation. In bones, fluoride alters the osteogenesis by replacing calcium, thus resulting in bone deformities. In skeletal muscles, high concentration and long term exposure to fluoride causes loss of muscle proteins leading to atrophy. Although fluorosis is quite a familiar problem, the exact molecular pathway is not yet clear. Extensive research on the effects of fluoride on various organs and its toxicity was reported. Indeed, it is clear that high and chronic exposure to fluoride causes cellular apoptosis. Accordingly, in this review, we have highlighted fluoride-mediated apoptosis via two vital pathways, mitochondrial-mediated and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. This review also elaborates on new cellular energetic, apoptotic pathways and therapeutic strategies targeted to treat fluorosis.","Fluoride affects dental health by altering dentinogenesis, which impacts tooth enamel formation.",question,1349,96.0

20489,what are the positive effects of open-borders?,"International migration, open borders debates, and happiness","Arguments for “open borders” typically assume that migration from poorer countries to wealthy countries generally makes the migrants themselves better off; indeed, many discussions of ethics concerning immigration policy depend heavily on this assumption. But there are several grounds for wondering whether it is at least partly unfounded for economic migrants (if not for refugees), particularly if “better off” is specified in terms of happiness. Research on happiness casts doubt on the notion that increases in income contribute significantly to happiness; this article extends those doubts to the notion that one can increase happiness by gaining more income via labor migration. Certain processes (for example, adaptation, social comparisons) might work in counterintuitive ways for immigrants, perhaps inhibiting happiness despite ostensible economic gains. Arguments against immigration restrictions might therefore need to focus more on the dysfunctions of restrictions themselves and less on putative benefits to migrants from migration.","Open borders debates assume migration from poorer to wealthier countries makes migrants better off, but happiness research casts doubt on income's contribution to happiness.",question,1048,173.0
8592,is neuroticism hereditary or due to other factors,Meta-analysis of genome-wide SNP- and pathway-based associations for facets of neuroticism,"Neuroticism is a heritable personality trait that is comprised of distinct sub-factors, or facets. Sub-factors of neuroticism are linked to different emotional states or psychiatric symptoms and studying the genetic variants associated with these facets may help reveal the biological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. In the present study, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for six facets of neuroticism was performed in 5584 participants from three cohorts. Additionally, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was conducted to find biological pathways associated with each facet. Six neuroticism facets (N1: anxiety, N2: angry hostility, N3: depression, N4: self-consciousness, N5: impulsivity and N6: vulnerability) were assessed using the Korean version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. In the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based analysis, results showed genome-wide significance for N2 within the MIR548H3 gene (rs1360001, P=4.14 × 10−9). Notable genes with suggestive associations (P<1.0 × 10−6) were ITPR1 for N1, WNT7A for N2, FGF10 and FHIT for N3, DDR1 for N4, VGLL4 for N5 and PTPRD for N6. In the pathway-based analysis, the axon guidance pathway was identified to be associated with multiple facets of neuroticism (N2, N4 and N6). The focal adhesion and extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathways were significantly associated with N2 and N3.

10261,can caffiene improve athletic performance?,Effects of carbohydrate combined with caffeine on repeated sprint cycling and agility performance in female athletes,"BackgroundCaffeine (CAF) has been shown to improve performance during early phase of repeated sprint exercise; however some studies show that CAF also increases the magnitude of physical stress represented by augmented blood lactate, glucose, and cortisol concentrations during latter phase of repeated sprint exercise. No studies have investigated the efficacy of combined carbohydrate (CHO) and CAF consumption during repeated sprint exercise (RSE) in female athletes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CAF with CHO supplementation on RSE and agility.MethodsEleven female athletes completed four experimental trials performed 7 d apart in a double-blind, randomized, and counter-balanced crossover design. Treatments included CAF + PLA (placebo), CAF + CHO, PLA + CHO, and PLA + PLA. Participants ingested capsules containing 6 mg · kg−1 of CAF or PLA 60-min prior to RSE, and 0.8 g · kg−1 of CHO solution or PLA immediately before the RSE, which consisted of ten sets of 5 × 4-s sprints on the cycle ergometer with 20-s active recovery. The agility T-test (AT-test) was performed before and after the RSE. Blood samples were acquired to assess glucose, lactate, testosterone, and cortisol.ResultsDuring Set 6 of RSE, peak power and mean power were significantly higher in PLA + CHO than those in CAF + PLA and PLA + PLA, respectively (p < .05). Total work was significantly increased by 4.8% and 5.9% with PLA + CHO than those of CAF + CHO and CAF + PLA during Set 3. PLA + CHO also increased total work more than CAF + PLA and PLA + PLA did during Set 6 (p < .05). No significant differences in AT-test performance either before or after the RSE were occurred among treatments (p > .05). Blood lactate and glucose concentrations were significantly higher under CAF + CHO, CAF + PLA, and PLA + CHO versus PLA + PLA (p < .05), but no differences in testosterone or cortisol levels were found (p > .05).ConclusionsFindings indicate that CAF + PLA or CAF + CHO ingestion did not improve repeated sprint performance with short rest intervals or agility.

12694,Do relationships make people happy?,Life Satisfaction Crossover Among Couples,"There is lettle research available on the ways relations between marital partners affect each other’s well-being and quality of life. What is known, however, suggests that happiness or unhappiness is contagious among couples. For example, happy people have traits, such as compassion and trustworthiness that promote happiness in others (Veenhoven, 1988). Unhappy people have traits such as egocentricity and disagreeableness that lead to unhappiness for their associates (Gotlib, 1992; Segrin and Dillard, 1992). Emotional sustenance works to generate well-being of both married men and married women. Although women receive less emotional sustenance compared with men, they benefit more than men from the marriage’s emotional make-up (Williams, 1988). Thus, it may be inferred that spousal relations contribute quite importantly to subjectively experienced quality of life. The concept of crossover applies to interpersonal relations and the mutual consequences of the flow of feeling states between individuals. Among couples, crossover occurs when one spouse’s personal disposition affects his or her spouse’s dispositions in similar ways (Sears and Galambos, 1992). Furthermore, crossover effects are conditional on work satisfaction or dissatisfaction experienced by working spouses (Hammer et al., 2005). Crossover effects between spouses have been found in research on expatriate cross-cultural adjustment (Takeuchi et al., 2002) and marital dissatisfaction (Westman et al., 2004). More specifically, life satisfaction crossover—the interpersonal contagion of happiness or unhappiness between marital partners—remains a neglected area of study. In the present research, we investigate the within-household crossover in life satisfaction among dual career parents. This kind of crossover effect has not been directly examined in previous research, and requires theoretical scrutiny. Crossover of happiness between spouses may be explained by the extended self theory (Belk, 1988, 1989; Morgan, 1993; Sivadas and Venkatesh, 1995). Based on this theory, one spouse may to some degree be psychologically incorporated as part of the other spouse’s self. Extended self implies (1) personal and social aspects (i.e., the degree the spouse is a definition of the self), (2) symbolic and functional aspects (i.e., one spouse enables the other spouse to be and do what is desired), and (3) control and Life Satisfaction Crossover Among Couples","Happiness or unhappiness is contagious among couples, with one spouse's disposition affecting the other's in similar ways.",question,2441,122.0

This study compared the effects of pre-sleep supplementation of a protein blend (PB) composed of micellar casein (MCa) and whey protein (1:1) versus isolate MCa on the plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, a critical intracellular pathway involved in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis. After 10 h of fasting during the active phase, rats were fed with a single dose of PB or MCa (5.6 g protein/kg of body mass) by gavage, and samples of blood and gastrocnemius muscle were collected at 30, 90, and 450 min. PB and MCa supplementations induced an increase (~3-fold, P < 0.001) of plasma BCAAs at 30 and 90 min. Most importantly, the stimulatory phosphorylation levels of mTOR and its downstream target p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) were similarly higher (~2.5-fold, P < 0.001) 30 and 90 min after MCa and PB.

17206,does homeopathic muscle testing work?,Effect of homeopathic preparations of Syzygium jambolanum and Cephalandra indica on gastrocnemius muscle of high fat and high fructose-induced type-2 diabetic rats,"BACKGROUND
Homeopathy is a holistic method of treatment that uses microdoses of natural substances originating from plants, minerals, or animal parts. Syzygium jambolanum and Cephalandra indica are used in homeopathy for treatment of type-2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for such effects are not known.


METHODS
Homeopathic preparations of S. jambolanum and C. indica in mother tincture, 6c and 30c were used to examine the molecular mechanism of antidiabetic effects in the skeletal muscle of rats with high fat and fructose-induced type-2 diabetes mellitus. After 30 days treatment, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin and insulin signaling molecules in the skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) were measured.


RESULTS
Diabetic rats showed a significant decrease in serum insulin and lipid profile as well as low levels of insulin receptor (IR), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (Akt), p-Akt(ser473) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) protein expression (p < 0.05) with a significant increase in fasting blood glucose level (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. Treatment with homeopathic remedies significantly increased the serum insulin and expression of these proteins (p < 0.05) with a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose (p < 0.05) compared to diabetic rats.

EB2007), 3 times a week for 8 weeks. The exercise started at 14:00 (14E) or 18:00 (18E). The proximate meal located 4h after exercise for 14E and immediately after exercise for 18E. The rats were fed either a normal protein diet (N, protein 18%) or a high protein diet (H, protein 35%), and each diet group was divided to a sedentary (S), 14E or 18E group. The rats were pair‐weighted. Nitrogen balance measured in the 7th week of the study was more positive in the H‐fed groups than the N‐fed groups without differences regarding both meal timing and exercise. After 8 weeks, the skeletal muscle mass (sum of the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, Extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, flexor hallucis longus and biceps brachii) was lower in the H‐fed rats than the N‐fed rats, and it was lower in 14EH (8.29g (SD 0.63)) than both SH (8.99 (0.38)) and 18EH (9.22 (0.53)) while SH and 18EH were comparable. The difference in the skeletal muscle mass between H‐fed and N‐fed was less in 18E than both S and 14E (SN > SH (−3.1%), 14EN > 14EH (−7.7%), 18EN = 18EH (−0.8%)). These results suggest that ingesting a meal in proper timing after exercise may not increase the upper limit of dietary protein for skeletal muscle growth, while it appears to alleviate the decreased efficiency of skeletal muscle growth in H‐fed animals.",Ingesting a meal immediately after exercise appears to alleviate the decreased efficiency of skeletal muscle growth in high-protein-fed animals.,question,1586,144.0

10781,why people use social networking sites,Review of Security Approaches for Social Networking,"Social networking uses different applications and dedicated websites for the communication to the user located at remote site. People having similar interest are connected through social networking. Online social networking uses different websites. Such websites are called as social networking sites. Social networking creates community of interested users. Online communities shares hobbies, common interest, lifestyle, views, politics, and knowledge. Sharing will helps even reading the profiles of other users, commenting on status, contacting others users indirectly. Ultimately personal information of any user can be known by any other easily. Misuse of personal information disturbs the mental, physical, social, psychological state of mind of user. Economical loss is major impact .Rapid growth in social networking are responsible for giving rise to many attacks that are entering from cyber world to real life. Structural anomaly and psychological profiling helps to identify behavior of attacker. Using Psycho-linguistic cues deception is identified. Protection motivation theory helps to motivate online social networking user for safe surfing.

17338,what is the prevalence of malaria in nigeria?,End malaria for good: a review of current strategies and future novelties for malaria elimination in Nigeria,"Abstract Malaria is endemic in 91 countries and territories. Currently, over half of the world’s population is at risk for malaria with malaria prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa remaining the highest in the world. Nigeria accounts for 56% of malaria cases in the West African sub-region. Malaria control is historically the oldest control programme in Nigeria, having been in existence since 1948. Malaria control in Nigeria is guided by National Malaria Strategic Plans. The goal of the NMSP (2014-2020) is ‘to reduce malaria burden to pre-elimination levels and bring malaria-related mortality to zero’ using strategies under seven strategic objectives. The theme for the 2017 World Malaria Day activities was ‘End Malaria for Good’. This theme indicates a sustained push for national and international commitments toward goal zero. Although the prevalence of malaria has dropped significantly, from 42% in 2010 to 27.4% in 2015, a lot of effort needs to be made to actualise a malaria-free Nigeria. This review discusses the current strategies in place to control and eliminate malaria.

14946,breathing exercise in acute pain?,Breathing techniques- A review,"Physiotherapy should be offered to patients with a variety of medical respiratory conditions with the aim of breathlessness management and symptom control, mobility and function improvement or maintenance, and airway clearance and cough enhancement or support. Breathing exercises is used as strategy in Lung expansion therapy, Bronchial hygiene therapy and PT techniques to reduce work of breathing. Breathing exercises can be classified as inspiratory and expiratory as some exercise stresses more of inspiration while some stresses expiration. Breathing exercises are used in Restrictive as well as obstructive conditions. In restrictive types of disorders Deep Breathing, Diaphragmatic Breathing, Deep Diaphragmatic Breathing, End – Inspiratory hold, Sustained Maximal Inspiration, Slow Maximal Inspiration, Incentive Spirometer, Sniff, Segmental (Apical and Lateral Costal Activity) are commonly used. Abdominal Breathing, Air Shift Breathing, Glossopharyngeal Breathing are commonly effective in spinal cord injuries. Stacked Breathing, Air Shift Breathing are used in localized and generalised atelectasis of upper lobe respectively. Chest mobility exercises and Belt exercises are used to prevent the formation of disabling adhesions between two layers of pleura. Active cycle breathing technique and Autogenic Drainage are commonly used for clearance of secretions. Breathing Control Technique, Innocenti Technique, Pursed Lip Breathing are used during acute exacerbation and End – Expiratory hold, Buteyko Breathing, Exhale With Activity, Stressed Respiratory Exercises, Panting, Pacing are commonly used when the subjects are in stable phase. Inspiratory Muscle Training, Isocapnic Hyper Ventilation, Inspiratory Resistive Training, Inspiratory Threshold Training are used to improve strength and endurance of respiratory muscles. Breathing Cycle Technique is used in chronic hyperventilation where there is breathlessness without an organic cause.

In Indonesia, scabies is still a public health problem. Scabies is found in places with unsanitary environments and poor personal hygiene such as dormitories, Islamic boarding schools and prisons. In LPKA Pekanbaru City, there were 38.33% cases of scabies. This case increased from the previous year, where cases in 2017 were 34%. This study aims to analyze the factors that influence the incidence of scabies in the Class II Class II Special Development Institution for Children in Pekanbaru City in 2019. The research design used was cross sectional with a sample size of 120 children obtained using the total population. The instrument used in this study was a questionnaire. The data obtained in this study were analyzed by univariate, bivariate and multivariate using multiple logistic regression tests. The results showed that there was a relationship between cleanliness of clothes (p = 0.003), cleanliness of towels (p = 0.014), and environmental sanitation (p = 0.042) with the incidence of scabies.

14,Can Creatine treat concussions?,Reduced brain glutamine in female varsity rugby athletes after concussion and in non‐concussed athletes after a season of play,"The purpose of this study was to use non‐invasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to monitor changes in prefrontal white matter metabolite levels and tissue microstructure in female rugby players with and without concussion (ages 18–23, n = 64). Evaluations including clinical tests and 3 T MRI were performed at the beginning of a season (in‐season) and followed up at the end of the season (off‐season). Concussed athletes were additionally evaluated 24–72 hr (n = 14), three months (n = 11), and six months (n = 8) post‐concussion. Reduced glutamine at 24–72 hr and three months post‐concussion, and reduced glutamine/creatine at three months post‐concussion were observed. In non‐concussed athletes (n = 46) both glutamine and glutamine/creatine were lower in the off‐season compared to in‐season. Within the MRS voxel, an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and decrease in radial diffusivity (RD) were also observed in the non‐concussed athletes, and correlated with changes in glutamine and glutamine/creatine. Decreases in glutamine and glutamine/creatine suggest reduced oxidative metabolism. Changes in FA and RD may indicate neuroinflammation or re‐myelination. The observed changes did not correlate with clinical test scores suggesting these imaging metrics may be more sensitive to brain injury and could aid in assessing recovery of brain injury from concussion.","Reduced glutamine/creatine was observed in concussed athletes, but the study does not directly address creatine as a treatment for concussions.",question,1428,143.0

15930,nicotine effects based on gender on humans,Acute and chronic effects by nicotine on striatal neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the female rat brain,"Introduction Tobacco use is in part a gendered activity, yet neurobiological studies outlining the effect by nicotine on the female brain are scarce. The aim of this study was to outline acute and sub-chronic effects by nicotine on the female rat brain, with special emphasis on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Methods In vivo microdialysis and ex vivo electrophysiology were performed in nicotine naïve female Wistar rats, and following sub-chronic nicotine exposure (0.36 mg/kg free base, 15 injections). Locomotor behavior was assessed at the first and last drug-exposure. Results Acute exposure to nicotine ex vivo depresses excitatory neurotransmission by reducing the probability of transmitter release. Bath applied nicotine furthermore facilitated long-term synaptic depression induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS-LTD). The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonist WIN55,212-2 produced a robust synaptic depression of evoked potentials, and HFS-LTD was blocked by the CB1R antagonist AM251, suggesting that HFS-LTD in the female rat DLS is endocannabinoid mediated. Sub-chronic exposure to nicotine in vivo produced behavioral sensitization and electrophysiological recordings performed after 2-8 days abstinence revealed a sustained depression of evoked population spike amplitudes in the DLS, with no concomitant change in paired pulse ratio. Rats receiving sub-chronic nicotine exposure further demonstrated an increased neurophysiological responsiveness to nicotine with respect to both dopaminergic- and glutamatergic signaling. However, a tolerance towards the plasticity facilitating property of bath applied nicotine was developed during sub-chronic nicotine exposure in vivo. In addition, the dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole selectively facilitate HFS-LTD in slices from nicotine naïve rats, suggesting that the tolerance may be associated with changes in dopaminergic signaling. Conclusion Nicotine produces acute and sustained effects on striatal neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the female rat brain, which may contribute to the establishment of persistent nicotine taking habits.",Nicotine produces acute and sustained effects on striatal neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the female rat brain.,phrase,2230,124.0
14284,what is the authoritarian parenting style?,"To study the relationship between Parental authority, personality, self-efficacy and life satisfaction among school-going children","Background: Parenting is the state of being a parent. Being a parent, you have to ensure children’s health and safety, transmit cultural values, and preparing children for life as an adult. Baumrind identified three forms of parenting styles: authoritative parenting style is where elders love and discipline the child, authoritarian parenting style is where the elders are strict as well as demanding, and the Permissive parenting style is where elders implement very little rules and permit kids to form their own decisions. Aim: This study aimed to research the relationship and effects of parental authority on personality dimensions, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life. Methodology: ninety students served as participants for this study and age ranged from 13-17 years and an equal range of boys and girls. The following scales were administered on participants: The Parental Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) by Buri (1991), Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) by Gosling et al.

6679,does fish oil fail to improve symptoms of depression?,Lipid correlates of antidepressant response to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation: A pilot study.,"Low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels are seen in major depression. We examined effects of six weeks of fish oil supplementation on clinical characteristics in 16 patients with symptomatic major depressive disorder, and tested plasma phospholipid levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as correlates of clinical response. Depression symptoms improved after supplementation (p=0.007). The reduction in depression severity was not predicted by baseline PUFA levels but did exhibit a relationship with endpoint PUFAs, correlating negatively with DHA as a percentage of plasma phospholipids (DHA%; R2=0.60, p=0.004), adjusting for endpoint EPA%; and correlating positively with endpoint EPA% (R2=0.58, p=0.007), adjusting for endpoint DHA%. Thus, the higher the proportion of DHA to EPA, the greater the reduction in depression severity (r=-0.43, p=0.097). Five patients showed a decrease of >50% on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and a final score <7 and were thus not only responders but met standard criteria for remission, and were distinguished from non-responders by higher levels of DHA% (p=0.03). This pilot study suggests that post-supplementation DHA% levels may be a necessary target for antidepressant response to fish oil, and that this may depend to some extent on the efficacy of EPA conversion to DHA.","Depression symptoms improved after fish oil supplementation, with higher proportions of DHA to EPA resulting in greater reduction in depression severity.",question,1372,153.0

The course was based on the principles of distance learning; it utilised the open-source learning management system - Moodle, and it was implemented as an action research project for three consecutive semesters (2014-2016). Its pedagogical aim was to investigate a prototype model of digital learning: the 'interactive evaluation' that was embodied in the design of the e-course and in the cycles of action research. Acting as creators, teachers and researchers in order to investigate the student-evaluators' perceptions of the e-course, we attempted to 'produce' wider knowledge of the assessment criteria within the context of blended education. In particular, the how and why specific learning criteria and critical approach to knowledge can be organised as more general constructivist and student-centred indexes of the learning technology. As a case study, the research outcomes revealed factors related to expression of interest, encouragement for participation and motivation of students to infiltrate, evaluate the e-course and contribute to remodelling its educational material.","The research outcomes revealed factors related to student interest, participation, and motivation in evaluating and contributing to the improvement of an e-course within a blended education context.",phrase,1287,198.0
11872,relation between anxiety and therapy expectations,[Patient anxiety and expectations surrounding the use of medication].,"Patients who take prescription drugs are thought to feel both ""anxiety"" and ""expectations"" surrounding medication use. Anxiety is felt regarding medication effectiveness, side effects, and potential dependency, and is believed to impact medication adherence, which declines to less than 50% after six months. A good therapeutic relationship between patients and physicians, which allows discussion of such topics as side effects, or the duration of ongoing medication use, is required to relieve patient anxiety, but doctor-patient communication usually does not meet patients' expectations: A discrepancy exists between what clinicians report they communicate to patients, and patients' perceptions of what they were told. At the same time, patients also maintain positive expectations for change induced by pharmacotherapy. These expectations can be inferred to be closely related to the placebo effect, which is reported to account for 30% of overall therapeutic effect. However, at the beginning of treatment, few patients are seeking pharmacotherapy; rather, they hope to share their worries with physicians, or talk about the difficulties of their illness with therapists. Physicians must therefore work to understand patients' treatment preferences, and should make initial treatment decisions only after sharing information and thoroughly consulting with patients.",A good therapeutic relationship between patients and physicians is required to relieve patient anxiety and meet their expectations surrounding medication use.,phrase,1372,158.0
16006,what is the mechanism of transport in slc26 proteins?,Evidence for multiple somatic pools of individual axonally transported proteins,"The idea that individual axonally transported proteins can exist in several kinetically distinct pools within the cell body was studied using the presumptive neurosecretory low molecular weight (LMW) proteins of Aplysia neurons L11 and R15. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the loss of labeled LMW proteins from the soma by axonal transport does not follow single exponential kinetics as it should if they are being removed from single pools. Rather, decay of label occurs in at least two phases having half-lives of approximately 1 and 40 h. The LMW proteins are homogeneous by sequential SDS gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, indicating that individual protein species exhibit multiphasic decay kinetics. Two types of evidence imply that the bulk of cellular LMW protein turns over at the slower rate: the LMW pool does not reach constant specific activity at the rapid rate during continuous exposure to labeled precursor, and long-term blockade of axonal transport does not produce an appreciable accumulation of these species in the cell body. These results suggest that some of the newly synthesized LMW protein enters a small somatic pool from which it is rapidly subjected to axonal transport, while the remainder enters a larger pool where it can mix with previously synthesized protein before transport. A cellular mechanism that would yield this behavior is suggested.","This paper suggests that individual axonally transported proteins exist in multiple kinetically distinct pools within the cell body, with some entering a small somatic pool for rapid transport and others entering a larger pool before transport.",question,1396,244.0
13404,what is the role of catalase in uterus?,Polymorphism of catalase gene (CAT C-262T) in women with endometriosis,"Abstract Endometriosis is defined as the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine cavity. Recent studies have shown that the oxidative stress causes irreparable damage, which leads to oxidative enzymopathies. Catalase gene encodes an antioxidant enzyme, detoxifying hydrogen peroxide to H2O and O2. The aim of this study was to determine whether the polymorphism at position -262 in the promoter region of catalase gene (C-262T), which alters the expression and enzyme blood levels, could have an impact on the risk of endometriosis. Extracted DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes was genotyped using allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). The χ2-test was used for statistical analyses. In endometriosis subjects, the frequencies of the CAT CC/CT/TT were 67.5%, 32.5% and 0%, respectively, while in healthy women, they were 12%, 68% and 20%, respectively. Significant differences in allele and genotype distribution among controls and patients were found (OR, 178.76 95% CI, 10.11–3159.1202; p = 0.0004).

1872,are regulatory t cells hard to induce in atherosclerosis?,Establishment of nasal tolerance to heat shock protein-60 alleviates atherosclerosis by inducing TGF-β-dependent regulatory T cells,"SummaryMounting evidence supports that a newly identified regulatory T cell (Treg), CD4+LAP+ Treg, is associated with oral tolerance induction and following inhibition of atherosclerosis, but little is described about whether nasal tolerance to antigen likewise induces the novel Tregs production and the relevant antiatherosclerotic benefit. We investigated the effect of nasal administration of heat shock protein-60 (HSP60) on atherogenesis. HSP60 or phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was nasally administered to six-week-old male ApoE−/− mice. At the 10th week after the nasal administration, there was a significant decrease in atherosclerotic plaque areas of aortic roots in the HSP60-treated mice as compared with those in the PBS-treated mice. Atherosclerosis suppression was accompanied with a significant increase in CD4+LAP+ and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs and a concurrently increased production of TGF-β in the HSP60-treated mice. The protective effect of HSP60 was offset by injection of anti-TGF-β antibody. It is concluded that nasal administration of HSP60 can inhibit atherosclerotic formation through immune tolerance which is established by Tregs depending on the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β.

13566,does higher education leads to higher income,"Management 101 at the ""New Oxford""","private, social, and economic benefits—from improved health to lower rates of welfare dependency and greater contributions to the tax base. Unfortunately, public pronouncements about why higher education matters, including those from university presidents, tend to focus on the fact that going to college enhances one’s personal economic status. The rich combination of societal and individual benefits of higher education is largely overwhelmed by the reality that university degree holders make an average of U.S.$1 million more over their lifetimes than non–degree holders. This obsession with private economic benefits has been a factor in the rapid rise in tuition rates, with a growing share of the financing burden shifted to students. As a result, concerns over student access have grown. While overall enrollments have increased substantially over the last 30 years, the gap between the lowest and highest income groups, and between minorities and others, has remained virtually unchanged.

Investigation of the Effectiveness of Data Integration and Interoperability Methods Applied to Mental Health. 2018. 126 f. Tese (Doutorado em Ciências Médicas – Área de Concentração: Clínica Médica) – Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto (FMRP/USP), Ribeirão Preto – SP. Contextualization: The availability and integration of health information from the same patient between different care levels or between different health services is usually incomplete or non-existent. This happens especially because the information systems that support health professionals are not interoperable, making it difficult to manage services at the municipal and regional level. This fragmentation of information is also challenging and worrying in the area of mental health, where long-term care is often required and integrates different types of health services and professionals. Problems such as poor quality and unavailability of information, as well as duplicate records, are important aspects in the management and long-term care of patients with mental disorders. Despite this, there are still no objective studies that demonstrate the effective impact of interoperability and data integration on the management and quality of data for the mental health area. Objectives: In this context, this project proposes an interoperability architecture for regionalized health care management. It also proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of data integration and interoperability techniques for the management of mental health hospitalizations in the Ribeirão Preto region as well as the improvement in data availability through well-defined metrics. Methods: The proposed framework is based on client-service architecture to be deployed in the web. The interoperability information model was based on international and national health standards. It was proposed a terminology server based on health information standards. Record Linkage algorithms were implemented to guarantee the patient identification. In order to test and validate the proposal, we used data from different health care levels provided by the mental health care network in the Ribeirão Preto region. The data were extracted from five different sources: the Family Health Unit I of Santa Cruz da Esperança, the Center for Integrated Health Care of Santa Rita do Passa Quatro, Santa Tereza Hospital, the information on hospitalization requests system in SISAM (Mental Health Information System) and demographic data of the Brazilian Ministry of Health Bus. Results: As a result of this work, the health interoperability platform, called eHealth-Interop, was designed, developed and tested. A proposal was adopted for interoperability through web services with a data integration model based on a centralizing database. A terminology server, called eHealth-Interop Terminology Server, has been developed that can be used as an independent component and in other medical contexts. In total, 31340 patient records were obtained from SISAM, eSUS-AB from Santa Cruz da Esperança, from CAIS from Santa Rita do Passa Quatro, from Santa Tereza Hospital and from the CNS Service Bus from the Brazillian Ministry of Health. 47% (9548) records were identified as present in more than 1 information source, having different levels of accuracy and completeness. The data quality analysis, covering all integrated records, obtained an improvement in the average completeness of 18.40% (from 56.47% to 74.87%) and the mean syntactic accuracy of 1.08% (from 96,69% to 96.77%). In the consistency analysis there were improvements in all information sources, ranging from a minimum improvement of 14.4% to a maximum of 51.5%. With the Record Linkage module it was possible to quantify 1066 duplications, of which 226 were manually verified. Conclusions: The information’s availability and quality are both important aspects for the continuity of care and health services management. The solution proposed in this work aims to establish a computational model to fill this gap. It has been successfully applied in the mental health care context and is flexible to be extendable to other medical domains.

15274,what are the advantages of use pgpr microorganisms to combat climate change?,Effects of Compost Amendment on Glycophyte and Halophyte Crops Grown on Saline Soils: Isolation and Characterization of Rhizobacteria with Plant Growth Promoting Features and High Salt Resistance,"Soil salinization and desertification due to climate change are the most relevant challenges for the agriculture of the 21st century. Soil compost amendment and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGP-R) are valuable tools to mitigate salinization and desertification impacts on agricultural soils. Selection of novel halo/thermo-tolerant bacteria from the rhizosphere of glicophytes and halophytes, grown on soil compost amended and watered with 150/300 mM NaCl, was the main objective of our study. Beneficial effects on the biomass, well-being and resilience, exerted on the assayed crops (maize, tomato, sunflower and quinoa), were clearly observable when soils were amended with 20% compost despite the very high soil electric conductivity (EC). Soil compost amendment not only was able to increase crop growth and biomass, but also their resilience to the stress caused by very high soil EC (up to 20 dS m−1). Moreover, compost amendment has proved itself a valuable source of highly halo-(4.0 M NaCl)/thermo tolerant rhizobacteria (55 °C), showing typical PGP features. Among the 13 rhizobacterial isolates, molecularly and biochemically characterized, two bacterial strains showed several biochemical PGP features. The use of compost is growing all around the world reducing considerably for farmers soil fertilization costs. In fact, only in Italy its utilization has ensured, in the last years, a saving of 650 million euro for the farmers, without taking into account the environment and human health benefits. Furthermore, the isolation of halo/thermo-tolerant PGPR strains and their use will allow the recovery and cultivation of hundreds of thousands of hectares of saline and arid soils now unproductive, making agriculture more respectful of agro-ecosystems also in view of upcoming climate change.","Compost amendment and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGP-R) can increase crop growth, biomass, and resilience to stress caused by high soil electric conductivity, helping recover and cultivate unproductive saline and arid soils.",question,1816,235.0
3830,how can l-carnitine affect energy metabolism,"L-carnitine supplementation improves fatigue, mood and sleep in cancer patients with fatigue and carnitine deficiency.","8588 Background: Carnitine is a natural aminoacid derivative that plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. To determine the dose and tolerability we conducted a phase II study with increasing doses of L-carnitine supplementation. In a preliminary analysis, we reported that L-carnitine could improve fatigue, mood and sleep. (Cruciani et al., 2004). Analysis of the full dataset has confirmed and extended these findings.


METHODS
Patients had active cancer, fatigue and a Karnofsky ≥50. Carnitine deficiency was defined as free carnitine <35 μm]/L for males and <25 for females (normal range 35-67 and 25-55 respectively), or a ratio of acyl/free carnitine >0.4. We utilized a standard maximum tolerated dose (MTD) design, with 3 patients assigned to each successive dose group, starting at 250 mg/day and increasing in each group by 500 mg/day to a maximum dose target of 3000 mg/day. Fatigue (measured by the BFI), depressed mood (CES-D), quality of sleep (ESS), and performance status (Karnofsky), as well as carnitine serum levels were assessed at baseline and after one week of L-carnitine supplementation.


RESULTS
Seven groups of three patients each received L-carnitine supplementation for a week with 250, 750, 1,250, 1,750, 2,250, 2,750 or 3,000 mg/day. Of the 27 patients accrued 21 completed the study. Of these, 17 (mean (SD) age = 63.0 (18), females=8) showed an increase in serum L-carnitine levels. The median (min, max) total carnitine increased from 31 (21, 68) to 51 (29, 111) (p < 0.001) and the free carnitine increased from 25.0 (17, 48) to 39 (25, 82) (p < 0.001). The median (min, max) BFI score at baseline was 63 (36, 81) versus 39 (8, 82) after one week (p<0.001). There was also a significant dose response for BFI (r = -0.61, p = 0.01). Median (min, max) CES-D at baseline was 31. (4, 48) and 18.0 (0, 40) after one-week (p = 0.001). Median (min, max) ESS at baseline was 13.7 (2, 22) and 10.3 (1, 18) after one week (p=0.003). Median Karnofsky score did not change (pre and post = 70). Side effects were not observed in any of the groups.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests that L-carnitine is safe up to 3,000 mg/day. Supplementation was associated with improvements in fatigue and depression scores. Fatigue improved in a dose dependent manner.

6344,how does subjective economy influence vote choice,Two types of economic voting: How economic conditions jointly affect vote choice and turnout,"Abstract The economic voting literature mostly looks at vote choice, ignoring potential effects on turnout. Studies that do focus on the latter often ignore the former, and come to contradictory conclusions. I develop a model of economic voting that jointly incorporates vote choice and abstention due to alienation or indifference. Analyzing ten elections with validated turnout data and conducting empirically informed simulations, I make two contributions. First, I show that “turnout switching” accounts for up to one third of total economic voting. This second type of economic voting is more common when the number of parties is low and responsibility is dispersed. Second, I show that a bad economy moves some people to abstain while having the opposite effect on others. The aggregate effect is ambiguous and related to macro-conditions in a non-linear way. This explains contradictory findings in the literature.","Subjective economy affects both vote choice and turnout, with a bad economy causing some people to abstain and others to vote differently, depending on macro-conditions.",question,921,169.0
23777,how has the work-week changed in history,Trying Out the Four Day Work Week,"Attention was first called to the ""four day work week"" as it spread through the industrial towns of Massachusetts and moved westward into the Central States. Initially, it had been applied primarily in small, mostly non-unionized manufacturing companies of about 500 employees or less but, as the idea gained momentum, more and more companies began to climb onto the bandwagon. Few of these were capital intensive (Le., requiring a heavy investment in capital equipment), few were competing in world markets and few had contracts with locals of the large national unions. But, nonetheless, the list kept growing in both number and diversity and by the beginning of 1971, more than 200 companies in the United States-and even more on the international scene-were experimenting with the rearranged week. Hospitals, banks, police departments, advertising agencies, insurance companies, retailing establishments, publishing outfits, architectural firms and professional organizations all were represented and perhaps, the list would have grown even longer and more inclusive had not the provisions of the three month wage freeze prevented many companies from revising their work schedules.' At first glance, the shortened week may appear to he a relatively new phenomenon but a closer look will reveal that it has a long history in two related trends that have steadily gained strength in American industry. The first is a trend toward increasing diversity in work schedules as shown by the new plans for flexible hours, staggered hours and most recently the ""gliding workday"" (in which workers can arrive and leave at any time within a twelve hour period as long as they work the total number of required hours each week). The second is the trend toward shorter days and more leisure time which was spurred by the union movement and which has remained in the forefront of union demands. Interestingly, this trend toward a shorter work week, which was practically unbroken for almost a century, was reversed some 25 years ago. At that time, government workers eagerly accepted a lengthening of the work week from thirty-nine hours to forty in order to have a two day weekend. Similarly, the four day week, with its longer hours also reverses the trend toward shorter days, and this has been the cause of considerable debate and dissension whenever unions have been approached on the issue. Many unions see the four day week as a","By 1971, over 200 companies in the United States were experimenting with the four-day work week, including hospitals, banks, and police departments.",question,2424,148.0

There is no consensus on the size below which it is justifiable to accept or attempt to modify the size of the penis. Length of the penis under 10 cm in erection can be considered as an acceptable limit, in a patient who suffers from it. The assessment of men asking for penile enlargement must include a psycho-sexological looking for a dysmorphophobia or another psychiatric condition. Penile extenders under medical control must be the first-line treatment option for patient seeking penile lenghtening procedure when justified. In case of failure, three techniques can be used alone or in combination: penile lengthening by section of the suspensory ligaments and suprapubic skin advancement, lipectomy of Mons pubis and scrotal webbing section. The results are modest, the rate of complications significant and satisfaction low. Girth enlargement techniques by injection of autologous fat, give inconsistent aesthetic results and satisfaction rates are low. All other techniques remain experimental.

8092,what is the role of prefrontal cortex in metacognition,Overview of Prefrontal Functions: E Pluribus Unum – Coordinating New Sequences of Purposeful Action,"A functional model of the prefrontal cortex is developed from the material in the preceding chapters. The main general function of prefrontal cortex, to coordinate novel sequences of goal-directed behavior and speech, comprises several executive functions (planning, attentional set, working memory, decision-making, error monitoring and avoidance, and inhibitory control) performed in conjunction with other cortical and subcortical structures. These functions operate on a vast array of distributed, interactive cortical networks named cognits. Cognits are units of memory and knowledge, formed by experience through the synaptic association of neuronal assemblies representing simultaneous sensations and/or actions. Perceptual cognits are hierarchically self-organized in posterior cortex, executive cognits in frontal cortex. All cognitive functions serving the pursuit of new goal-directed behavior occur, under prefrontal control, in the perception–action cycle, the cybernetic adaptive interface between the organism and its environment. Since some functions are future oriented, the prefrontal cortex and perception–action cycle are both adaptive and preadaptive.","The prefrontal cortex coordinates novel sequences of goal-directed behavior and speech, involving executive functions like planning, attention, working memory, decision-making, and inhibitory control.",question,1172,200.0

The potential of chitosan (irradiated and unirradiated) in preserving pomegranate arils (cv. Wonderful) during cold storage was investigated in this trial. Solid chitosan powder was gamma irradiated with 25 and 50 kGy doses, chitosan solutions were prepared and arils were treated prior to cold storage. Initial arils quality characteristics were assessed before refrigeration at 5 o C and RH 75 % for up to 15 day, during which studied characteristics were determined trice, with a 5 day interval. Different treatments were applied by immersion in one of the following for 2 min with: Control (distilled water); 0.5%, unirradiated chitosan; 0.5%, 25 kGy irradiated chitosan; 0.5%, 50 kGy irradiated chitosan; 1.0 %, unirradiated chitosan; 1.0 %, 25 kGy irradiated chitosan; 1.0 %, 50 kGy irradiated chitosan solutions). Results revealed that chitosan treatments reduced weight loss and controlled reductions in total soluble solids, titratable acidity, vitamin C and anthocyanin contents.

19104,what is the characteristic of breast cancer brain metastasis?,Clinical features and survival analysis of different subtypes of patients with breast cancer brain metastases.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The brain is one of the most common metastatic sites of breast cancer. Brain metastases develop in 10%-15% of patients with breast cancer and are associated with poor prognosis. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the clinical characteristics and survival of patients with brain metastases due to breast cancer of different subtypes and to identify the prognostic factors that affect clinical outcome.


METHODS
A total of 89 patients with breast cancer brain metastases diagnosed between October 1997 and July 2008 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were included in this study. Among the 89 patients, the number of luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and triple-negative (TN) subtypes were 30, 20, 16, and 14, respectively; 9 patients had an unknown subtype. The clinical characteristics, pathologic features, and prognostic factors were analyzed both at the initial diagnosis and at the diagnosis of brain metastases. Endocrine therapy for patients with luminal subtypes was further studied.


RESULTS
The median age of patients was 46 years (range 28-74 years). The median survival time was 8.0 months (range, 0-80 months), the 1-year survival rate was 32% and the 5-year survival rate was 4%. The time to brain metastasis differed according to clinical stage at the initial diagnosis, and the time for patients with the luminal A subtype was the longest (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that performance status score > 1, multiple brain metastases and without whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in combination with chemotherapy were associated with poor prognosis. Compared with the luminal A subtype, features of the HER-2 and TN subtypes included early metastases, rapid progression after first-line treatment (8.0 months vs. 11.0 months), and poor overall survival (25.0 months vs. 63.0 months). The luminal A subtype showed a tendency for good prognosis and slow growth. Tamoxifen could improve the survival of luminal A/B subtypes (median survival 24.0 months vs. 7.0 months, respectively, P = 0.002).


CONCLUSIONS
The prognosis of brain metastases from breast cancer was poor, especially in patients with HER-2 and TN subtypes. Generally, WBRT in combination with chemotherapy was the standard treatment modality.

However, the reproductive toxicity of anticancer drugs is a major concern for young female cancer patients. Previous studies have suggested that DHA can cause embryonic damage and affect oocyte maturation. Here, we explored the side effects of DHA exposure on ovarian somatic cells. We exposed porcine granulosa cells to 5 μM and 40 μM DHA for 24 h or 48 h in vitro. DHA inhibited granulosa cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and, in the 48 h treatment group, DHA enhanced the apoptotic rate. We observed that the levels of intracellular calcium, mitochondrial calcium, and ATP concentration were elevated with DHA treatment. In granulosa cells exposed to DHA, the mRNA levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes GRP78 and ATF4 were increased. Furthermore, analysis of the unfolded protein response signaling pathway showed that the protein levels of P-PERK, P-eIF2α, and ATF4 were upregulated by DHA exposure. These results demonstrate that in granulosa cells, DHA exposure induces endoplasmic reticulum stress that then activates the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 signaling pathway, thus providing insight into the mechanism underlying DHA-induced reproductive toxicity, and giving reference to DHA use in females.","DHA exposure inhibits granulosa cell viability and enhances apoptotic rate, indicating potential reproductive toxicity in females.",question,1394,130.0

The agent’s pharmacology lends itself for concern regarding recreational misuse (Drugs of Abuse, 2017). Kratom’s increasing popularity for use in the USA is reflected by National Poison Data System data that in 2011 there were 13 cases reported to poison control centers while in 2017 there were 682 calls in response to kratom exposure (Kratom exposure in the US linked to serious medical outcomes, 2019; Post et al. in Clin Toxicol. 57:847–54, 2019). Subjects most commonly use kratom for the self-treatment of pain, mood swings, and opioid-related withdrawal symptoms (Grundmann in Drug Alcohol Depend. 176:63–70, 2017). Known serious adverse events include hallucinations, delusions, reduced respiratory drive, and death (Kratom: unsafe and ineffective, 2019).

1118,does whole grain have a lower glycemic index?,The Glycemic Index,"What is the Glycemic Index? The glycemic index is a ranking of carbohydrate containing foods. Foods are ranked according to their immediate effect on blood sugar levels. The higher a food raises blood sugar, the higher its glycemic index. Scientists published the first index in 1981 when they were researching diet therapy for diabetes. This first list contained 51 foods, and the list has continued to expand, with the most recent official list containing 750 foods. Fruits, grains, dairy products, some vegetables, pastas, and sugary desserts all contain carbohydrates, but have a wide range of glycemic indices. Meats, fats and some vegetables have none or very small amounts of carbohydrates and thus the glycemic index of these foods is low or close to zero. Pure glucose is used as the standard to which other foods are compared, and is given the glycemic index of 100. Most of today’s researchers use pure glucose as the standard mainly because it is the end product of digestion. However, white bread was the original reference food used when determining glycemic index levels. Glucose has a set index level of 100, which is considered the top of the scale. All other foods containing carbohydrates are ranked from 0 to 100 based on their effects on blood sugar compared to glucose. A few foods do have a higher glycemic index than glucose, with indexes over 100, such as jasmine rice, dates, and tofu based frozen desserts. Refined sugars and processed foods such as cookies, cakes, white breads, and crackers generally have high glycemic indexes. Whole grains and some fruits generally have lower glycemic indexes. Figure 1 shows an example of a person’s blood sugar response to a high versus a low glycemic index food.

Adiponectin has emerged as a promising insulin-sensitizing adipokine; however, the mechanisms by which adiponectin administration improves insulin sensitivity are unclear. Here, we show that globular adiponectin (gAcrp30) and full-length adiponectin (Acrp30) reverse insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice through reductions in ectopic lipid in liver and muscle likely by stimulation of LPL activity in eWAT and increased eNOS/AMPK activation and fat oxidation in muscle. These effects, in turn, lead to decreased plasma membrane diacylglycerol content, resulting in decreased PKCε activation in liver and decreased PKCε/PKCθ activity in muscle and improved insulin signaling in these tissues.","Adiponectin administration improves insulin sensitivity in mice by reducing ectopic lipid in liver and muscle, stimulating LPL activity, and increasing eNOS/AMPK activation and fat oxidation.",question,861,191.0

5547,what is composite?,Surface Roughness and Fiber Angular Orientation Analysis Toward Laminated Composite Crack Propagation,"Composite is a material that consisting of two or more materials, either micro or macro, where the properties of the material differ in shape and chemical composition from the original substance. In this study, fatigue testing of fiber metal composites was carried out to determine the rate of crack propagation so that the age of the fiber metal composite specimen was known. The independent variable in this research is the angular orientation of the carbon fiber and the surface roughness of the aluminum with the dependent variable response is the bridge crack rate. The manufacture of fiber metal laminates specimens uses the Vacuum Resin Infuse (VARI) method, which uses a vacuum pump as a means to flow the resin from the reservoir to the mold. This method is used to minimize the occurrence of air bubbles trapped on the specimen which causes porosity defects which will reduce the strength of the metal laminates specimen itself. Fatigue testing is performed using the stress amplitude method. That is, the value of the load when the tensile test is one third of the tensile strength. After the fatigue test was carried out, the results were obtained on specimens with an angular orientation of 0/90 ° fibers, the crack propagation rate slowed down with a cycle value of 90000 in specimens with a surface roughness value of 2.128 µm then decreased cycles on specimens with a value of 2.887 µm, namely 11000 cycles.","A composite is a material made up of two or more different materials with differing properties, such as fiber metal composites in this study.",question,1423,141.0
1090,how effective is exercise at lowering blood pressure?,Effectiveness of physical activity in the prevention and treatment of hypertension: A mini review,"Physical activity (PA) is associated with a clear decrease in blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of PA as an adjunct therapy in support of the prevention and pharmacological treatment of hypertension. Studies that reported on the correlation of PA and exercise on BP control among hypertensive patients from 1994 to 2019 were evaluated. PubMed electronic database was utilized. The MeSH system was used to extract relevant research studies from PubMed using the following keywords: “Exercise,” “training,” “hypertension,” “blood pressure,” “systematic review,” and “meta-analysis,” All selected articles were published in English. Sedentariness negatively affects cardiometabolic health, body composition, and BP among hypertensive patients, whereas PA significantly improves cardiometabolic parameters and body composition and leads to an overall improvement in cardiac parasympathetic system by increasing vagal tone, causing a reduction in resting heart rate, and systolic BP in hypertensive adults. Exercise should be tailored according to patient's clinical and functional status to avoid imposing variable internal training load on the patients.

18335,what is the relationship between low birth weight and insulin disruption?,Relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus and low maternal birth weight.,"OBJECTIVE
To study the relationship between low birth weight and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or peripheral insulin resistance during pregnancy.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We studied the relationship between peripheral insulin sensitivity (calculated by Matsuda and DeFronzo's oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived insulin sensitivity index [ISI(OGTT)]) or GDM prevalence and birth weight in 604 pregnant women, classified as normally glucose tolerant (n = 462) or affected with GDM (n = 142) after a 100-g 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. We then categorized these subjects into two groups: individuals with birth weight in the <10th percentile (<2,600 g; n = 68) and individuals with birth weight in the >10th percentile (n = 536).


RESULTS
GDM prevalence was higher in the group in the lowest birth weight decile (<2,600 g; 24/68; 35%) than in the group with normal/high birth weight (118/536; 22%; chi(2) = 5.917; P = 0.01). Relative risk for GDM adjusted for age, parity, family history of diabetes, and prepregnancy body weight was about twofold in the group with low birth weight (odds ratio = 1.89 [95% CI 1.088-3.285; P = 0.023]), and the prevalence of low birth weight was about threefold higher in the first ISI(OGTT) decile. In 450 women whose newborn's weight was known, the delivery of macrosomic babies was associated with a twofold higher relative risk for GDM in women who themselves had low birth weight. In the latter, the relationships between their newborn's weight and either maternal glucose tolerance (positive) or ISI(OGTT) (negative) were amplified.


CONCLUSIONS
Low maternal birth weight was associated with a twofold higher risk for GDM, independent of major confounders. Such a risk was highest in women with low birth weight who delivered macrosomic babies, and in the group with low birth weight, the relationship between maternal glucose tolerance or insulin resistance and offspring's neonatal weight was much more evident.","Low maternal birth weight is associated with a twofold higher risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), independent of major confounders.",question,1989,141.0

Despite low levels of trust in social media, they are used for accessing political information and news. In this study, we examine the information verification practices of opinion leaders (who consume political information above average and share their opinions on social media above average) and of opinion seekers (who seek out political information from friends and family) to understand similarities and differences in their news media trust, fact-checking behaviors, and likeliness of being caught in echo chambers. Based on a survey of French Internet users (N = 2,000) we find that not only opinion leaders, but also opinion seekers, have higher rates across all three of these dependent variables. We discuss the implications of findings for the development of opinion leadership theory as well as for social media platforms wishing to increase trust.","Opinion leaders and seekers have higher rates of news media trust, fact-checking behaviors, and likeliness of avoiding echo chambers.",question,1052,133.0

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Lexia® Core5® Reading edtech program (Core5) on the Measures of Academic Progress® (MAP) Growth Reading™ and easyCBM oral reading fluency performance of students with reading or language-based disabilities in Grades K to 5. Core5 systematically addresses multiple reading domains and previously was effective in general education. We hypothesized treatment students using Core5 would outperform controls on the reading assessments. This was a cluster randomized effectiveness evaluation, with condition assignment by school (three treatment and two business-as-usual control schools). Participating students in Grades K to 5 (N = 115; nTreatment = 65) were flagged by their district as needing reading intervention and had Individualized Education Program (IEP) designations of specific learning disability, speech or language impairment, or developmental delay.

15894,does microplastics alter the morphology of specimens?,Exposure of Human Lung Cells to Polystyrene Microplastics Significantly Retards Cell Proliferation and Triggers Morphological Changes.,"Microplastics in the environment produced by decomposition of globally increasing waste plastics have become a dominant component of both water and air pollution. To examine the potential toxicological effects of microplastics on human cells, the cultured human alveolar A549 cells were exposed to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) of 1 and 10 μm diameter as a model of the environmental contaminants. Both sizes caused a significant reduction in cell proliferation but exhibited little cytotoxicity, as measured by the maintenance of cell viabilities determined by trypan blue staining and by Calcein-AM staining. The cell viabilities did not drop below 93% even at concentrations of PS-MPs as high as 100 μg/mL. Despite these high viabilities, further assays revealed a population level decrease in metabolic activity parallel in time with a dramatic decrease in proliferation rate in PS-MP exposed cells. Furthermore, phase contrast imaging of live cells at 72 h revealed major changes in the morphology of cells exposed to microplastics, as well as the uptake of multiple 1 μm PS-MPs into the cells. Confocal fluorescent microscopy at 24 h of exposure confirmed the incorporation of 1 μm PS-MPs. These disturbances at the proliferative and cytoskeletal levels of human cells lead us to propose that airborne polystyrene microplastics may have toxicologic consequences. This is the first report of exposure of human cells to an environmental contaminant resulting in the dual effects of inhibition of cell proliferation and major changes in cell morphology. Our results make clear that human exposure to microplastic pollution has significant consequence and potential for harm to humans.",Exposure to polystyrene microplastics significantly retards cell proliferation and triggers morphological changes in human lung cells.,question,1692,134.0

16868,Do you need to hit failure to stimulate muscle hypertrophy?,EFFECTS OF TEN WEEKS OF EITHER MULTIPLE-SET TRAINING OR SINGLE-SET TRAINING ON STRENGTH AND MUSCLE MASS,"Background It is generally accepted that strength and muscle mass can be increased by strength training programs. Results are known to depend on training volume and training intensity.1 2 Strength increases when performing sets to the Repetition Maximum (PM) or even to the point of momentary muscular failure (PmF) and muscle hypertrophy has been proven to be superior to the results of sets performed at lower levels of intensity.3 4 Methods In this study (n=43) subjects trained twice a week for ten weeks. One group performed high-intensity training (n=16) and did only one drop-set of each exercise to the point of momentary muscular failure (HIT), whereas the other group (n=14) performed as many repetitions as possible in each set and did three sets of each exercise (3ST). The control group (n=13) did not strength train at all. The body composition of all groups was analysed in weeks 0 and 11. Subjects also performed strength tests for nine exercises in weeks 0 and 11. Results Strength tests and bioelectrical impedance analysis (Tanita MC 180, MA) show increased strength and muscle mass in both training groups but not in the control group.5 However, both strength and muscle mass increased to a greater extent in HIT than in 3ST. After ten weeks of training HIT increased the maximum number of repetitions in the nine test exercise by an average of 25 (15.7/40.3) repetitions per exercise while 3ST increased repetitions by an average of only 15 (6.4/24) repetitions per exercise. Furthermore, HIT increased to a significantly greater extent than 3ST while simultaneously decreasing body fat. Discussion/Conclusions One set of HIT is sufficient to improve muscle mass and strength. On average, results over a training period of ten weeks are better than those of 3ST. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of HIT and 3ST training periods longer than ten weeks.","One set of high-intensity training (HIT) to momentary muscular failure is sufficient to improve muscle mass and strength, with better results than multiple-set training over ten weeks.",question,1888,184.0

The samples were analyzed for morphology, acid–base and electrolyte balance, iron status, lipid profile, interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, non-enzymatic antioxidants, activities of selected enzymes including antioxidant enzymes, and total antioxidant status.ResultsThe sustained ultra-endurance run caused hypocapnic alkalosis with slight hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia, but no hyponatremia. Blood biochemistry showed severe muscle but not liver damage, and an acute inflammatory response. These effects were evidenced by leukocytosis, several fold rises in interleukin-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein, extreme elevations in serum levels of muscle enzymes, and marked increases in cardiac biomarker levels. Most of the changes dissolved during the 48 h post-race recovery. Neither the iron pool, nor erythropoiesis, nor pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance were substantially affected.ConclusionsThe changes consequent on the ultra-endurance run do not pose a serious health risk in men who begin their endeavor with ultra-endurance running in mid-life. There is some circumstantial evidence that hyperventilatory hypocapnia may modulate inflammatory response by stimulating the release of interleukin-6 from working skeletal muscles.","A 48-hour ultra-marathon run caused severe muscle damage and an acute inflammatory response, but most changes dissolved during the 48-hour post-race recovery, posing no serious health risks.",phrase,1824,190.0

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 1,260 ml of HRW intake on physiological, perceptual, and performance responses to a resistance training and after 24 hours of recovery. This randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study included 12 men aged 23.8 ± 1.9 years. Subjects performed a half squat, knee flexion, and extension exercises with the load set at 70% of 1 repetition maximum for 3 sets (10 reps/set). Lunges were performed with a load of 30% of body mass for 3 sets (20 reps/set). Time of each set, lactate, and ratings of perceived exertion were assessed mid-way through exercise and immediately after the exercise. Creatine kinase, muscle soreness visual analog scale ratings, countermovement jump, and heart rate variability were evaluated before the training and at 30 minutes, 6, and 24 hours of recovery. Lunges were performed faster with HRW compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Hydrogen rich water reduced lactate at mid-way and immediately after the exercise (HRW: 5.3 ± 2.1 and 5.1 ± 2.2, placebo: 6.5 ± 1.8 and 6.3 ± 2.2 mmol·L−1, p ≤ 0.008). Visual analog scale ratings were significantly lower with HRW (26 ± 11 vs. 41 ± 20 mm, p = 0.002) after 24 hours of recovery.

17227,what is loneliness?,Do You Feel Lonely? You are Not Alone: Lessons from Social Neuroscience,"DEFINITION OF LONELINESS Described in the scientific literature more than 30 years ago, the feeling of being lonely is characterized as feeling socially isolated or on the social perimeter [3]. It is noteworthy that feeling lonely does not necessarily mean being physically alone. Loneliness corresponds to a discrepancy between the relationships one wants and the relationships one has, so one can feel socially isolated even when they are among “friends.” As the celebrity, George Clooney, said: “Anyone would be lying if they said they did not get lonely at times. The loneliest you will get is in the most public of arenas: you will go to a place and end up in the smallest compartment possible, because it is a distraction to everybody, and you end up not getting to enjoy it like everyone else.” Although loneliness makes people feel sad, it has another, less obvious effect on our brain and biology: it triggers a sense in which the world is unsafe, and the brain tilts toward a self-preservation mode.","Loneliness is characterized as feeling socially isolated or on the social perimeter, and corresponds to a discrepancy between the relationships one wants and the relationships one has.",question,1009,184.0

Case Description: A 48-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of odynophagia and xerostomia, which began during chemotherapy (cetuximab) and radiation therapy (66 Gy in 33 fractions) for treatment of his clinical stage T1N1M0 squamous cell carcinoma at the base of his tongue. Odynophagia was described as aching pain at the base of his tongue and throat, which felt like his throat was swollen and was worse with swallowing. He also reported xerostomia, with associated dysphagia, difficulty speaking, and decreased sense of taste. The patient had failed pilocarpine, biotin rinse, speech therapy, and other options. Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes and skin hyperpigmentation on the neck that was consistent with radiation therapy. The musculoskeletal and neurological examination of the head, neck, and upper extremities were otherwise unremarkable. He received weekly 20-minute sessions of acupuncture (using combination of manual acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, and auricular acupuncture) for 10 sessions. The patient completed a standardized questionnaire regarding his symptoms at each session. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Results or Clinical Course: The patient reported resolution of his odynophagia after 4 acupuncture sessions, with the most dramatic improvement after session 2 (50%) and session 3 (90%). The patient reported gradual improvement of his xerostomia, with 3040% improvement, over 10 acupuncture sessions.

8763,effect of cbm on cognitive biases,Modification of cognitive biases related to posttraumatic stress: A systematic review and research agenda.,"Cognitive models of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) postulate that cognitive biases in attention, interpretation, and memory represent key factors involved in the onset and maintenance of PTSD. Developments in experimental research demonstrate that it may be possible to manipulate such biases by means of Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM). In the present paper, we summarize studies assessing cognitive biases in posttraumatic stress to serve as a theoretical and methodological background. However, our main aim was to provide an overview of the scientific literature on CBM in (analogue) posttraumatic stress. Results of our systematic literature review showed that most CBM studies targeted attentional and interpretation biases (attention: five studies; interpretation: three studies), and one study modified memory biases. Overall, results showed that CBM can indeed modify cognitive biases and affect (analog) trauma symptoms in a training congruent manner. Interpretation bias procedures seemed effective in analog samples, and memory bias training proved preliminary success in a clinical PTSD sample. Studies of attention bias modification provided more mixed results. This heterogeneous picture may be explained by differences in the type of population or variations in the CBM procedure. Therefore, we sketched a detailed research agenda targeting the challenges for CBM in posttraumatic stress.","CBM can modify cognitive biases and affect (analog) trauma symptoms in a training congruent manner, with mixed results for attention bias modification.",phrase,1412,151.0

Our mixed-methods study of 402 head-to-head encounters from the English Premier League (2000–2005) reveals that transferred players improve the performance of the recipient team in head-to-head encounters against the donor.

19940,Can caffiene improve athletic performance?,Does Iron Supplementation Improve Performance in Iron-Deficient Nonanemic Athletes?,"Context: Supplementing iron-deficient nonanemic (IDNA) athletes with iron to improve performance is a trend in endurance sports. Objectives: To investigate the benefits of iron on performance, identify a ferritin level cutoff in IDNA athletes, and determine which iron supplementation regimens are most effective. Data Sources: A search of the PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, and Cochrane databases was performed in 2014 including all articles. Citations of pertinent review articles were also searched. In 2017, the search was repeated. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria comprised studies of level 1 to 3 evidence, written in the English language, that researched iron supplementation in nonanemic athletes and reported performance outcomes. Study Design: Systematic review. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Data Extraction: The search terms used included athletic performance, resistance training, athletes, physical endurance, iron, iron deficiency, supplement, non-anemic, low ferritin, ferritin, ferritin blood level, athletes, and sports. Results: A total of 1884 studies were identified through the initial database search, and 13 were identified through searching references of relevant review articles. A subsequent database search identified 46 studies. Following exclusions, 12 studies with a total of 283 participants were included. Supplementing IDNA athletes with iron improved performance in 6 studies (146 participants) and did not improve performance in the other 6 studies (137 participants). In the 6 studies that showed improved performance with iron supplementation, all used a ferritin level cutoff of ≤20 μg/L for treatment. Additionally, all studies that showed improved performance used oral iron as a supplement. Conclusion: The evidence is equivocal as to whether iron supplementation in IDNA athletes improves athletic performance. Supplementing athletes with ferritin levels < 20 μg/L may be more beneficial than supplementing athletes with higher baseline ferritin levels.","Iron supplementation in iron-deficient nonanemic athletes may improve athletic performance, especially in those with ferritin levels < 20 μg/L.",question,1997,143.0
18880,Can you reverse aging?,Stem cells to reverse aging,"Abstract As human life expectancy continues to increase and the birth rate continues to decline, the phenomenon of aging is becoming more prominent worldwide. Therefore, addressing the problems associated with global aging has become a current research focus. The main manifestations of human aging are structural degeneration and functional decline of aging tissues and organs, quality of life decline, decreased ability to resist diseases, and high incidence rates of a variety of senile degenerative diseases. Thus far, no ideal treatments have been found. Stem cell (SC) therapies have broad application prospects in the field of regenerative medicine due to the inherent biological characteristics of SCs, such as their plasticity, self-renewal, and multidirectional differentiation potential. Thus, SCs could delay or even reverse aging.

Members of the skills-based classes engaged in activities that aimed to cultivate perspective-taking, empathy, and compassion; members of the contact classes met with Jewish-Israeli peers; and members of the control group engaged in a general social studies program. Outcomes were measured a week before, immediately after, and 6 months following completion of the program.

21535,do ice baths help with recovery?,Scrotal cooling as a protective method in tissue preservation after testicular torsion,"Dear Editor, In our environment, we continue to witness that surgeons, after emergency scrotal exploration and detorsion, heat the testicles. Most surgeons are still guided by the view that heating the testicles dilates peripheral blood vessels, thereby promoting reperfusion and recovery of testicular tissue. Most often, after detorsion, before fixation, surgeons wrap the testicles with warm gauze, waiting for the testicles to ‘recover’. They find the fact of recovery in a visual change in the colour of the testicles, from darker to lighter. We also witness that in clinical practice, from the moment of suspicion of testicular torsion to the operation itself, many surgeons do nothing to preserve testicular tissue, although we are aware that every minute of ischemia is harmful to testicular tissue. As early as 1990, it was shown that the application of an ice bath to the ischemic testis, after 30 minutes of normothermic ischemia, significantly improves the vitality of the germinal epithelium [1]. It has been unequivocally found that lower temperature favourably affects pH, lactate values and testicular tissue morphology itself. Acidification is reduced, while the increase in lactate concentration is reduced by a decrease in temperature [2]. The protective effects of hypothermia, in ischemic testes, are reflected in histological and tubular changes. Cold rather than warm ischemia has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of morphologically and functionally normal Sertoli and Leydig cells [3, 4]. A better Cosentino score was recorded in the groups where hypothermia was performed [5]. Also, oxidative stress indicators, such as MDA, MPO, and SOD, are significantly lower in both serum and tissue after hypothermia, while antioxidant indicators such as GPx and CAT are significantly higher [6]. In the domain of all research on this topic, the temperature of 4°C proved to be the most optimal. The issue of ice use has already been mentioned in the late 80’s [7], and emphasized in the 90’s [8], but to this day we are witnessing that surgeons in our environment do not use the cooling method either before or after surgery. We want to emphasize that surgeons should seriously consider starting to use cold compresses immediately upon admission of a patient to the hospital, but also after detorsion in order to preserve testicular tissue as much as possible. Physicians of all other professions, especially family physicians and emergency physicians who frequently encounter this condition, should also be informed that in patients with suspected testicular torsion, cold compresses on the scrotum may have a protective effect on the course of treatment.",Applying an ice bath to ischemic testis significantly improves the vitality of the germinal epithelium and has protective effects on testicular tissue.,question,2685,151.0
20999,what is additives in polypropylene (pp) plastic food packaging?,The Effect of Manganese Palmitate as Pro-Oxidant Additive on Mechanical Properties of Polypropylene,"Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most widely used polymer materials, such as in textile, automotive spare part, furniture, household appliances, and packaging. However, PP is very difficult to degrade naturally. When the product from PP is not reused and discharged into the environment, this plastic can cause problems to the environment. One of the solution to improve degradability of PP is by adding pro-oxidant additives. The addition of pro-oxidant additives can make polypropylene to easily oxidize and degrade into shorter chains by producing carbonyl groups. The pro-oxidant additive used in this research is manganese palmitate. The additive was synthesized by reacting palmitic acid with sodium hydroxide and followed by reaction with manganese chloride tetrahydrate. The purpose of this research was to study the effect of manganese palmitate as a pro-oxidant additive to the structure and mechanical properties of PP before and after thermal treatment. The thermal treatment was carried out by providing heating in PP at various temperatures (25, 60, and 90°C) for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days. The structure and mechanical properties of PP was characterized by functional group analysis (FTIR) and mechanical properties (Tensile tester). FTIR spectra of PP film after thermal treatment at temperature 60 and 90°C showed the presence of carbonyl group in 1700-1720 cm−1 region. After thermal treatment at 90°C, PP film could not be analyzed by mechanical properties because it was damaged and destroyed. The peak intensity of the carbonyl group increased with the increasing temperature of heating. PP films with the addition of manganese palmitate both before and after thermal treatment have a lower tensile strength and elongation compared to the pure PP, but their modulus young are higher, so that the films of PP with addition of pro-oxidant became more fragile and rigid. In addition, the PP film with heating treatment at 90°C cannot be analysed due to it was damaged and destroyed.","Manganese palmitate is a pro-oxidant additive in polypropylene food packaging that helps improve its degradability, making it more fragile and rigid.",question,1998,149.0

24138,Do Cell Phones Cause Brain Cancer?,The problem with cell phones...or maybe not.,"It's a popular topic … and a baffling question, to boot. Do cellular phones cause brain tumors? 
 
Cell phones (or mobile phones, if you prefer) are ubiquitous. In the United States, current population about 307 million, there are more than 279 million wireless subscribers, say Inskip et al.1 in this issue of Neuro-Oncology; even allowing for users with multiple accounts (say, for work and personal use), that number is staggering. Worldwide, the story is the same: one study reports that there are now 4.6 billion subscribers,2 and another reports that about 50% of the world population (or some 3.3 billion people) were users in 2007.3 Yes, there is some variability in the numbers, but if cell phone use causes or even just elevates the risk for brain tumors … well, you get the picture: we will have plenty of patients for clinical trials. 
 
Do cell phones generate enough RF (radiofrequency) electromagnetic radiation to induce gene mutations and thus increase the risk of brain tumors? The evidence so far is equivocal. Some studies have shown an overall increase in incidence among long-term users, some an increase in only certain histologic types of brain tumors, and some no increase at all or—oddly—a reduction in incidence. Two recent meta-analyses both came down on the side of suggesting that there may be evidence of a link.3,4 So far, no one seems to be able to muster much more conclusiveness than that. 
 
Such analyses have been hindered by methodological inconsistency, potential bias, and reporting and recall inaccuracies—no surprise given the relative youth of the cell phone as a technology in widespread use and the intrinsic difficulties of analyzing epidemiologic events that may take years or even decades to evolve. Similar hindrances impede progress in understanding the risk of late effects from radiotherapy, for instance. And let's not even start on whether anthropogenic global warming is fact or fiction! 
 
We have some hope that the questions about a cell phone–brain tumor link will be answered, eventually. After all, it took years of study for people to accept that lead-based paint could contribute to impaired IQ and that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. What is required are time and evidence. Neuro-Oncology cannot alter the laws of physics and so can have no effect on the former, but we can contribute to the body of knowledge. 
 
In this issue, we do so by publishing the aforementioned article by Inskip et al.,1 who have delved into the records of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to gain more insight. Although this evidence is drawn from just the United States, its insights should be applicable worldwide, as biologic processes know no national borders.","Cell phone use may increase the risk of brain tumors, but the evidence is equivocal and the link remains unclear.",question,2750,113.0
188,does the covid vaccince cause myocarditis?,Intramyocardial Inflammation after COVID-19 Vaccination: An Endomyocardial Biopsy-Proven Case Series,"Myocarditis in response to COVID-19 vaccination has been reported since early 2021. In particular, young male individuals have been identified to exhibit an increased risk of myocardial inflammation following the administration of mRNA-based vaccines. Even though the first epidemiological analyses and numerous case reports investigated potential relationships, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB)-proven cases are limited. Here, we present a comprehensive histopathological analysis of EMBs from 15 patients with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF = 30 (14–39)%) and the clinical suspicion of myocarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty® (Pfizer-BioNTech) (n = 11), Vaxzevria® (AstraZenica) (n = 2) and Janssen® (Johnson & Johnson) (n = 2). Immunohistochemical EMB analyses reveal myocardial inflammation in 14 of 15 patients, with the histopathological diagnosis of active myocarditis according the Dallas criteria (n = 2), severe giant cell myocarditis (n = 2) and inflammatory cardiomyopathy (n = 10). Importantly, infectious causes have been excluded in all patients. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been detected sparsely on cardiomyocytes of nine patients, and differential analysis of inflammatory markers such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells suggests that the inflammatory response triggered by the vaccine may be of autoimmunological origin. Although a definitive causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the occurrence of myocardial inflammation cannot be demonstrated in this study, data suggest a temporal connection.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of restricting mobile phone use with time on the anxiety levels of undergraduate students having moderate nomophobia. The study also aimed to find whether cognitive and sensory distractions within the environment could delay anxious thoughts and subsequent rise in anxiety levels.


METHODS
Current research was based on a quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent control group, i.e., the participants were not randomly assigned to groups. The participants were 64 undergraduate students taken from a university located in Islamabad. The State trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and Nomophobia questionnaire (NMPQ) were used. The study was carried out between August to December 2017.The data collected was analysed using general linear model to see the significant effect of time and treatment on the state anxiety levels at different time intervals.


RESULTS
The findings from multivariate analysis revealed that the state anxiety increased significantly with time in participants having moderate nomophobia and who were not in contact with their mobile phones as hypothesized. However, cognitive and sensory distractions could only slightly delay the anxiety in fearful situations.

The highest multipoint logarithm of the odds (LOD) score found by Mustanski et al.2 was 3.45 near the microsatellite D7S798 on chromosome 7q36 with approximately equivalent maternal and paternal contributions. As with all studies of complex traits, this result requires confirmation. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)based scans for linkage provide significantly greater genomic coverage and information content than do microsatellite assays;3 hence, we applied this technology to study a Canadian cohort of homosexual males. A total of 55 Canadian Caucasian families with two or more homosexual male siblings were studied, ascertained as previously described.4 DNA samples were normalized for concentration before labeling and hybridization to the Illumina HumanLinkage-12 BeadChip Infinium array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), which comprises B6000 welldefined SNPs spread comparatively evenly across the human genome. The markers on the array exhibit low levels of linkage disequilibrium, and are thus suited for initial genome-wide screens. Genotype calls, generated using BeadStudio (Illumina), were obtained for 112 individuals. Pedigrees were verified using Pedstats,5 and data sets checked for unlikely genotypes; suspect sample SNP data points were removed from subsequent analyses. Nonparametric linkage analyses were carried out using MERLIN (http:// www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Merlin/ index.html).6 The results of the genome-wide linkage scan are shown in Figure 1.

8627,why is fusion energy so hard?,Chapter 17 – Nuclear Fusion,"Publisher Summary 
Nuclear fusion, the joining of light nuclei of hydrogen into heavier nuclei of helium, has potential environmental, safety and proliferation characteristics as an energy source, as well as adequate fuel to power civilization for times long compared to human history. It is, however, more challenging to convert to an energy source than nuclear fission. This chapter introduces the physics, advantages, difficulties, progress, economics and prospects for fusion energy power plants. Nuclear fusion is the process, in which light nuclei can release large amounts of energy if they combine, or fuse, into heavier nuclei. The principal nuclear reactions which have been considered for reactor concepts involve reactions of isotopes of the two lightest elements: hydrogen and helium. The fuel costs for fusion reactors will be negligible in comparison with the value of the electricity produced. It is difficult to precisely assess the cost of fusion-generated electricity until there is experience with an operating power plant, since the cost will be dependent upon the reliability and the frequency and expense of maintenance, both of which are likely to improve with the hindsight of experience. A fusion reactor does not directly emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases, or any combustion products that contribute to acid rain, and the indirect emissions due to factors like fuel gathering and transport, plant construction and maintenance, and activated parts storage would be small. Thus, fusion power would not have appreciable adverse effects upon global warming, atmospheric quality or acidification of the oceans, lakes and streams.",Fusion energy is challenging to convert to an energy source due to the difficulties in joining light nuclei of hydrogen into heavier nuclei of helium.,question,1652,150.0

21047,what causes adhd,Intermittent Hypoxia During Sleep as a Model of Environmental (Nongenetic) Contributions to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a clinically heterogenous neuropsychiatric syndrome of persistent and developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, typically of juvenile onset. Research on this disease has been complicated by the fact that the specific features and presentations of ADHD show substantial variability between individuals, and that no single pathophysiological profile of ADHD has been identified (1,2). Although the exact cause of ADHD is still unknown, both genetic and environmental factors are now recognized to play a role in the development of the disease (3, 4, 5). Children who suffer from sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have been reported to experience learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and impaired attention in much the same manner as children with ADHD, suggesting that SDB and some forms of ADHD may share common pathophysiological mechanisms (see Chapter 19). These findings in clinical populations with sleep disorders have led to the hypothesis that exposure to intermittent hypoxia, such as that encountered in SDB, during critical developmental periods is an important environmental contributor to the development of ADHD-like behavioral problems, and may be particularly important in individuals with a genetic predisposition to develop ADHD. In support of this hypothesis, data from animal experiments has shown that exposure to intermittent hypoxia, the primary hallmark of SDB, replicates many of the behavioral features of ADHD and may provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying some nongenetic forms of ADHD-like pathology.","Intermittent hypoxia during sleep, like in sleep-disordered breathing, may contribute to the development of ADHD-like behavioral problems, especially in those with a genetic predisposition.",question,1646,189.0

In terms of enjoyment, however, neuroticism interacted with the valence of the sequences: in the two conditions with negative valence (fearful and sad sequence), participants scoring high on neuroticism reported less enjoyment than those scoring low on neuroticism. Opposite results were observed in the funny sequence: participants scoring high on neuroticism enjoyed the funny sequence more than those scoring low on neuroticism. Thus, neuroticism increased presence within all conditions, whereas individuals scoring high on neuroticism only experienced increased enjoyment in positive media contents.","High neuroticism leads to less enjoyment in fearful and sad movie sequences, but more enjoyment in funny sequences.",question,979,115.0
17650,what is the relationship between self-efficacy and resistance training performance in athletes,Exercise self-efficacy and control beliefs: effects on exercise behavior after an exercise intervention for older adults.,"The current study examined exercise self-efficacy and exercise behavior during and after a strength-training intervention program with older adults. A model with cross-lagged and contemporaneous paths was tested with structural equations. Within testing occasions, higher physical resistance was related to greater beliefs in efficacy and control over exercise. At 3 months into the intervention, those who had higher physical resistance were less likely to show subsequent changes in beliefs. Those who had higher self-efficacy and control beliefs at 6 months were more likely to report that they were still exercising at 9 and 12 months after the intervention. Findings indicate that exercise self-efficacy and exercise behavior are associated with one another and that beliefs developed during an intervention are important for maintenance of an exercise regimen.",Higher physical resistance is related to greater beliefs in self-efficacy and control over exercise in older adults.,question,866,116.0
1641,why are crime rates decreasing over time?,Determinants of Crime Rates in Latin America and the World: An Empirical Assessment,"This study uses a new data set of crime rates for a large sample of countries for the period 1970-1994, based on information from the United Nations World Crime Surveys, to analyze the determinants of national homicide and robbery rates. A simple model of the incentives to commit crime is proposed, which explicitly considers possible causes of the persistence of crime over time (criminal inertia). Several econometric models are estimated, attempting to capture the determinants of crime rates across countries and over time. The empirical models are first run for cross-sections and then applied to panel data. The former focus on explanatory variables that do not change markedly over time, while the panel data techniques consider both the effect of the business cycle (i.e., GDP growth rate) on the crime rate and criminal inertia (accounted for by the inclusion of the lagged crime rate as an explanatory variable). The panel data techniques also consider country-specific effects, the joint endogeneity of some of the explanatory variables, and the existence of some types of measurement errors afflicting the crime data. The results show that increases in income inequality raise crime rates, deterrence effects are significant, crime tends to be counter-cyclical, and criminal inertia is significant even after controlling for other potential determinants of homicide and robbery rates.","Increases in income inequality, deterrence effects, counter-cyclical trends, and criminal inertia are determinants of crime rates.",question,1397,130.0
7496,Is caffeine effective at increasing performance?,The effects of caffeine ingestion on time trial cycling performance.,"PURPOSE
The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of caffeine on high intensity time trial (TT) cycling performance in well-trained subjects.


SUBJECTS
Six male cyclists with the following physical characteristics (mean +/- SD) age 30.7 +/- 12, height 179.3 +/- 7.5 cm, mass 70.0 +/- 7.5 kg, VO2max 65.0 +/- 6.3 mL.kg-1.min-1 undertook three 1-h TT performances, control (C), placebo (P) and caffeine (CAF), on a Velotron cycle ergometer conducted in a double-blind, random fashion. Subjects rested for 60 min and were then given CAF or P in a dose of 6 mg.kg-1 body mass and then commenced exercise after another 60 min of rest. Before ingestion, 60 min postingestion, and at the end of the TT, finger-prick blood samples were analyzed for lactate.


RESULTS
The cyclists rode significantly further in the CAF trial (28.0 +/- 1.3 km) than they did in the C (26.3 +/- 1.5 km, P < .01) or P (26.4 +/- 1.5 km, P < .02) trials. No differences were seen in heart rate data throughout the TT (P > .05). Blood lactate levels were significantly higher at the end of the trials than either at rest or postingestion (P < .0001), but there were no differences between the three trial groups.


CONCLUSION
On the basis of the data, we concluded that performance was improved with the use of a caffeine supplement.",Caffeine ingestion significantly increased cycling performance in well-trained subjects.,question,1315,88.0

18905,How effective is regenerative farming?,Regenerative Agriculture Augments Bacterial Community Structure for a Healthier Soil and Agriculture,"Use of chemical fertilization and pesticides not only harm the environment but also have detrimental consequences on human health. In recent years, there has been a major emphasis worldwide on natural agriculture methods. Regenerative agriculture is known across the world as a combination of nature-friendly farming practices such as no-till, cover cropping, crop-rotation, agro-forestry and use of organic home-based/farm-based ingredients to revive soil health. In India, a number of farmers are slowly adopting these practices using home-based mixtures and farmyard manure for soil rejuvenation and pest management. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the regenerative agriculture practices, this study compared conventional and regenerative agriculture plots for their soil bacterial and nutrient profiles. Two crops - ragi and vegetable (tomato/beans), and different lengths (≤3 and >5 years) of regenerative practices were additional metrics considered to understand variabilities due to crop-type and period of application. We found that all regenerative practices were effective in bringing about an enrichment for soil bacteria with a more heterogeneous composition. Additionally, the regenerative vegetable (RV) plots had an enhanced representation of Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria and Patescibacteria in comparison to conventional vegetable (CV) plots and Barren land (BL). Similarly, the regenerative ragi (RR) plots saw higher representation of Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota in comparison to conventional ragi (CR) plots and BL. The RV plots were also found to be enriched for Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPRs) - Pseudomonas sp., and RR plots were enriched for Bacillus sp., and Mesorhizobium sp., which are known to play significant roles in vegetable and ragi growth respectively. Interestingly, long-term regenerative agriculture was able to support good nutrient composition while enhancing Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) levels. In all, the regenerative agriculture practices were found to be effective in improving bacterial community structure and simultaneously improving soil health. We found that BL soil with eucalyptus plantation showed least bacterial diversity suggesting detrimental impact on soil health.","Regenerative agriculture practices improve soil health by enriching soil bacteria, enhancing bacterial diversity, and supporting good nutrient composition and Soil Organic Carbon levels.",question,2258,186.0

We report an investigation to determine if background music of the genre typically found in computer-based role-playing games has an effect on learning in a computer-animated history lesson about the Macquarie Lighthouse within an IVW. In Experiment 1, music stimuli were created from four different computer game soundtracks. Seventy-two undergraduate students watched the presentation and completed a survey including biographical details, questions on the historical material presented and questions relating to their perceived level of immersion. While the tempo and pitch of the music was unrelated to learning, music conditions resulted in a higher number of accurately remembered facts than the no music condition. One soundtrack showed a statistically significant improvement in memorisation of facts over other music conditions. Also an interaction between the levels of perceived immersion and ability to accurately remember facts was observed.

18139,ginger impact on nausea,Protein and ginger for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea.,"BACKGROUND
Nausea that develops during the period that begins 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy is called delayed nausea, and occurs in many patients with cancer. Meals high in protein decrease the nausea of motion sickness and pregnancy, possibly by reducing gastric dysrhythmias. Ginger also has antinausea properties.


OBJECTIVES
To explore the use of protein meals with ginger for the treatment of the delayed nausea of chemotherapy.


DESIGN
Twenty-eight (28) patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy for the first time were assigned to 1 of 3 groups. For 3 days beginning the day after their chemotherapy, Control Group patients continued with their normal diet, Protein Group patients consumed a protein drink and ginger twice daily, and High Protein Group patients consumed a protein drink with additional protein and ginger twice daily.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Patients recorded in a diary each day whether they had experienced nausea, whether their nausea had been frequent, whether their nausea had been bothersome, and whether they had needed any antiemetic medication. Gastric myoelectrical activity was assessed in 5 patients before and after ingestion of a high protein meal and ginger.


RESULTS
Reports of nausea, frequent nausea, and bothersome nausea were significantly less common among High Protein Group patients than among Control and Protein Group patients. Furthermore, significantly fewer patients in the High Protein Group used antiemetic medication. Differences between the Protein and Control groups were not statistically significant. In the 5 patients who had tests of gastric myoelectrical activity performed, a significant decrease in gastric dysrhythmia occurred after ingestion of the protein and ginger.


CONCLUSIONS
High protein meals with ginger reduced the delayed nausea of chemotherapy and reduced use of antiemetic medications. Protein with ginger holds the potential of representing a novel, nutritionally based treatment for the delayed nausea of chemotherapy.",High protein meals with ginger reduced the delayed nausea of chemotherapy and reduced use of antiemetic medications.,phrase,2020,116.0
11953,how does diet impact brain function,Pathophysiological Mechanisms on How Nutritionally Related Components Can Have a Negative Impact on Cognition,"Dietary factors have significant effects on cognition. Individual dietary-related factors might affect brain function in many different ways. For example, homocysteine, a diet-related factor, is directly toxic to neurons and astrocytes, activates microglia, and impairs endothelial function and blood–brain barrier. Homocysteine and its oxidized metabolite homocysteic acid may also increase beta-amyloid and increase phosphorylated tau protein in the presence of Alzheimer’s disease. 
 
The homocysteine–methionine cycle is vitally important for methylating reactions involved in the production of neurotransmitters and myelin, degradation of catecholamines, and neurogenesis. Dietary factors affect the local and systemic metabolism of homocysteine by influencing the demand for methylation, and by providing substrates and coenzymes in the cycle and its related metabolic pathways. Excess homocysteine may lower methylation potential in the brain, primarily due to the inhibitory effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine, a reversible metabolite of homocysteine, on methylation reactions.","Dietary factors affect brain function by influencing the homocysteine-methionine cycle, which is vital for neurotransmitter production, myelin formation, and neurogenesis.",question,1083,171.0

1701,the effects of sexism,The Use of Partial Least Squares–Path Modelling to Understand the Impact of Ambivalent Sexism on Violence-Justification among Adolescents,"Gender violence is generally conceived as a phenomenon concerning only adults. Nonetheless, it is also perpetrated within teenagers’ relationships, as many empirical studies have shown. We therefore have focused our attention on a non-probabilistic sample consisting of 400 adolescents living in Naples (Italy), to study the association between sexism and the justification of violent attitudes. Generally, sexism is recognised as a discriminatory attitude towards people, based on their biological sex. However, it is conventional to talk about sexism as a prejudice against women. The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) for adolescents was used to evaluate the two dimensions of ambivalent sexism, i.e., hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS). Moreover, the questionnaire regarding attitudes towards diversity and violence (CADV) was administered to assess participants’ attitudes towards violence. A Partial Least Square–Second Order Path Model reveals that girls’ ambivalent sexism is affected more by benevolent sexism than hostile sexism. On the contrary, among boys, hostile sexism has a higher impact. Finally, benevolent sexist girls justify domestic violence more than boys do.","Benevolent sexist girls justify domestic violence more than boys, and girls' ambivalent sexism is affected more by benevolent sexism than hostile sexism.",phrase,1194,153.0
14600,the benefits of adopting sustainable supply chain management,A systematic literature review of quantitative models for sustainable supply chain management.,"Supply chain management is the basis for the execution of operations, being considered as the core of the business function in the 21st century. On the other hand, at present, factors such as the reduction of natural resources, the search for competitive advantages, government laws and global agreements, have generated a greater interest in the sustainable development, which, in order to achieve it, industries need to rethink and plan their supply chain considering a path of sustainability. So sustainable supply chain management emerges as a means to integrate stakeholders' concern for profit and cost reduction with environmental and social requirements, attracting significant interest among managers, researchers and practitioners. The main objective of this study is to provide a synthesis of the key elements of the quantitative model offerings that use sustainability indicators in the design and management of forward supply chains. To achieve this objective, we developed a systematic literature review that includes seventy articles published during the last decade in peer-reviewed journals in English language. In addition a 4 W's analysis (When, Who, What, and Where) is applied and three structural dimensions are defined and grouped by categories: Supply chain management, modeling and sustainability. As part of the results we evidenced a continuous growth in the scientific production of this type of articles, with a predominance of deterministic mathematical programming models with an environmental economic perspective. Finally, we identified research gaps, highlighting the lack of integral inclusion of a life cycle analysis in the design of supply chain networks.",Adopting sustainable supply chain management integrates stakeholders' concerns for profit and cost reduction with environmental and social requirements.,phrase,1693,152.0
11314,Do isometric exercises improve tendon health and tendinopathy injuries?,The Effectiveness of Isometric Contractions Compared With Isotonic Contractions in Reducing Pain For In-Season Athletes With Patellar Tendinopathy.,"Clinical Scenario: Patellar tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal disorder affecting the lower-extremities and a difficult condition to manage for athletes that are in season. To facilitate improvement in function and to decrease pain, initial treatment for patellar tendinopathy is typically conservative. Traditional interventions may include eccentric training, cryotherapy, patellar counterforce straps, oral anti-inflammatories, injectable agents, phonophoresis, iontophoresis, orthotics, therapeutic ultrasound, and extracorporeal shockwave. In addition, recent literature suggests that implementing isometric and isotonic contractions may be effective in reducing patellar tendon pain. Focused Clinical Question: How effective are isometric contractions compared with isotonic contractions in reducing pain for in-season athletes with patellar tendinopathy? Summary of Key Findings: Implementation of isometric and isotonic exercises statistically reduced pain levels in the short term of 4 weeks for in-season athletes; however, isometric contractions provided statistically greater pain relief immediately for up to 45 minutes postintervention compared with isotonic contractions. Clinical Bottom Line: Current evidence supports the use of isometric and isotonic contractions to reduce pain for in-season athletes with patellar tendinopathy. Based on the reviewed literature, clinicians should consider utilizing heavy loaded isometrics or progressive heavy loaded isotonic exercises, which showed reduction in pain levels immediately after intervention and at 4-week follow-up for both intervention groups. Isometric contractions appear to provide greater pain relief immediately after intervention. Strength of Recommendation: There is Grade B evidence from 2 level 2 randomized controlled trials and 1 level 3 randomized crossover study supporting the use of isometric and isotonic contractions to reduce patellar tendon pain for in-season athletes.","Isometric and isotonic contractions both reduce pain for in-season athletes with patellar tendinopathy, but isometric contractions provide greater pain relief immediately after intervention.",question,1964,190.0

In contrast, we propose that automatic processing depends on a specific configuration of the cognitive system by top-down control. In 2 experiments, we tested the influence of available attentional resources and previously activated task sets on masked semantic priming in a lexical decision task. In Experiment 1, before masked prime presentation, participants were engaged in an easy or hard primary task that differentially afforded attentional resources. Semantic priming was attenuated when the primary task was hard, that is, when only little attentional resources were available. In Experiment 2, a semantic or perceptual induction task differentially modulated subsequent masked semantic priming. Hence, unconscious automatic processing depends on the availability of attentional resources and is susceptible to top-down control.",Unconscious automatic processing depends on the availability of attentional resources and is susceptible to top-down control.,question,969,125.0

The tests include the possibility of one and two structural changes to account for the occurrence of significant macroeconomic changes experienced by the Latin American economies. In addition, we estimate the order of integration of the series, allowing for fractional degrees of differentiation, to assess the persistence of unemployment in the region. Our results indicate that when endogenous structural changes are included in the model, in general we find evidence of mean reversion of unemployment rates for the Latin American countries under study.

7383,what is the importance of individualısm in team sports?,Physical Performance and the Relationship to Game Performance in Elite Adolescent Ice Hockey,"Determining performance indicators within team sports is considerably important as it facilitates the underlying training methodologies of sports performance. The value of understanding individual contribution and the relevant physical factors is of importance when structuring appropriate strength and conditioning training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the relationships between physical performance and game performance, as well as examining the relationships of physical performance and game performance dependent on competition level. This research project was a case study conducted with a team’s game performance measured across a full season. Twelve elite adolescent male ice hockey players (17.92 ± 0.9 years, 185 ± 8.45 cm, 83.17 ± 8.61 kg) participated in the study after giving informed consent. Physical performance was measured using four tests (horizontal jump, single-leg lateral jump, 15-meter sprint, corner S test), while game performance was calculated through the statistical equation Point Shares. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Physical performance did not depict any strong indications of overall game performance. Instead, results illustrated an inverse relationship between plyometric performance and offensive point shares. However, on-ice agility may be a relevant indicator of game performance dependent on competition level for individuals and sub-groups. Thus, the findings suggest that explaining individual performance within team sports is a highly complex issue that needs further investigation.","Individual performance in team sports is complex, but on-ice agility may be a relevant indicator of game performance depending on competition level for individuals and sub-groups.",question,1564,179.0

5130,effect of year building to house price,Housing markets and demographics,"Fifteen years ago, like today, there were concerns that house prices might collapse. One big difference between then and now, however, is the basis for those concerns. Today, people are worried that a house price bubble (if one exists) might burst, while 15 years ago, people were worried about demographic effects, specifically, the inevitable aging of the baby boomers. ; The earlier concern was sparked by a paper by Mankiw and Weil (1989), in which the authors famously predicted that between 1987 and 2007, real house prices could fall by 3% per year. In fact, real house prices grew by an average of 3-1/2% per year from 1987 to 2004. Of course, the Mankiw-Weil prediction may yet come to pass; or it may have already occurred and simply been masked by the surge in demand over the last seven years that is due to other factors. But the relationship between demographics and house prices remains interesting both because housing constitutes such a large component of the typical household's wealth, and because much remains to be understood about the consequences of the baby boomers liquidating their housing and financial assets. In this Economic Letter, I revisit the economics of the housing market and demographics.","Real house prices grew by an average of 3-1/2% per year from 1987 to 2004, despite concerns about demographic effects on the housing market.",phrase,1226,140.0
9309,why is semiconductor production mainly located in asia?,Machinery Trade in East Asia and the Global Financial Crisis,"The global financial crisis since Q3 2008 has influenced the world economy, including that of East Asia. This paper focuses on international production/distribution networks, mainly observed in the machinery sectors in East Asia, and attempts to examine patterns of machinery trade movements during the crisis to explore how and to what extent it has affected trade. More specifically, the paper analyzes these trade patterns, with distinctions between machinery intermediate goods and machinery final products, among trading partners (regions), between intra-regional trade and inter-regional trade, and among machinery sectors, so as to investigate whether there were any differences in reactions to the crisis. Moreover, in order to consider possible seasonality in trade, the paper also attempts to apply the X-12 model and discusses features of trade patterns based not only on actual trade values but also on estimated trade values with seasonal adjustment. Our results demonstrate that effects of the global financial crisis on international production/distribution networks in East Asia do indeed exist but, at the same time, that East Asia’s trade has rapidly recovered through the regional production/distribution networks. In particular, East Asia itself is the major contributor to such a rapid recovery, not only for machinery parts and components trade but also for the machinery final goods trade. This suggests that the existence of dense production/distribution networks in East Asia helps industries to avoid becoming destabilized. It also suggests that East Asia is increasingly gaining importance not only as the production site but also as the consumption site for final products that are produced in the production/distribution networks in the region, implying that [further] activation and expansion of intra-regional demand are essential.",Dense production/distribution networks in East Asia help industries avoid destabilization and the region is increasingly important as both a production and consumption site for machinery products.,question,1862,196.0

3087,can surface roughness influence reflectance?,Reflectance and transmittance model for multilayer optical coatings with roughness at oblique incidence,"Abstract Surface roughness is really important to the ultra-low loss of multilayer optical coatings. Reflectance and transmittance model for multilayer optical coatings with surface roughness has been established at normal incidence by A. V. Tikhonravov et al. in 2003. However, under the condition of oblique incidence, no further model which is based on the model of Tikhonravov has ever been reported. In this paper, an approximate reflectance and transmittance model is established for the thin film system with roughness at oblique incidence by analogy and usage of the concept of equivalent refractive index. The small-scale roughness model's effectiveness has been theoretically demonstrated according to the effective medium theory. However, the large-scale roughness model's effectiveness needs other methods to be proved, as the scattering effect of different scale roughness is different. This model might play a significant role to research the scattering loss of oblique incident thin film systems, such as mirrors in ring lasers, deep ultraviolet lasers and interferometers with ultra long cavity length.",Surface roughness is important to the ultra-low loss of multilayer optical coatings and can influence reflectance and transmittance at oblique incidence.,question,1118,153.0
5986,does psychological well being matter?,Challenges in Defining and Measuring Well-Being and Their Implications for Policy,"This chapter focuses on how psychologists understand and measure well-being and the related constructs, mental health and flourishing. For psychologists, well-being is about how people experience their lives, not the objective facts of their lives. Why does well-being matter? Although the instrumental benefits of well-being are frequently cited as the reason for its importance, it is argued here that they are merely a by-product of a high level of well-being. The real reason well-being matters is that well-being is an end in itself – an ultimate good. However, because there is as yet no agreed definition of well-being, there is no universally agreed method for measuring well-being. It is argued here that well-being is a combination of feeling good (the hedonic view) and functioning well (the eudaimonic view), and that in order to advance well-being science, we need a multi-dimensional approach to definition and measurement. Accordingly, at this early stage in the science of well-being, policymakers would be well advised to use measures which encompass a diversity of well-being constructs.","Well-being matters because it is an end in itself, an ultimate good, and its instrumental benefits are merely a by-product of a high level of well-being.",question,1105,153.0
358,what is the impact of exercise before pregnancy on improving pregnancy rates?,Determining the association between physical activity prior to conception and pregnancy rate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies,"Abstract We investigated the association between physical activity (PA) before pregnancy and pregnancy rate according to intensity and amount of exercise. Eleven prospective cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. Any amount of moderate-intensity PA was associated with a statistically higher rate of pregnancy compared to that in patients with no PA (p < .05). Any amount of vigorous PA was associated with decreased pregnancy rate; regular PA was associated with decreased infertility (p > .05). In contrast, vigorous PA was associated with increased infertility (p > .05). Therefore, women who are preparing for pregnancy are recommended to perform regular, moderate-intensity PA.","Moderate-intensity physical activity before pregnancy is associated with a higher pregnancy rate, while vigorous activity may decrease pregnancy rates.",question,695,151.0
19787,implementation of critical points in the pharmaceutical industry,An alternative approach to HACCP system implementation,"Abstract The practical implementation of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) and in particular the definition of the critical control points (CCPs) in the food industry is usually a complex structured task. This is particularly the case of small medium enterprise (SMEs), where quality/safety manager ability, knowledge of the production processes and “sensitiveness” is usually the discriminate for the proper identification and prioritization of risks. The same applies for the definition of causes which may lead to food safety hazards. This paper addresses the issues of how quality/safety managers can objectively and automatically implement the first and second principles of hazard analysis in the application of HACCP, which is the identification of risk priorities and of the related CCPs, by means of a structured, quantitative and qualitative methodology. The proposed methodology combines fault tree analysis (FTA) approach, for the analytical decomposition of the relevant steps in the manufacturing process of a food product, and fuzzy logic, for quantitative measures of occurrence likelihood. The practical implications of the methodology are finally tested through a real case application.","Quality/safety managers can implement HACCP principles by using a structured, quantitative, and qualitative methodology that combines fault tree analysis and fuzzy logic.",phrase,1221,170.0

We argue that the number of new venues is a proxy for investor attention. We find that the number of new venues is a significant driver of crypto volatility. Moreover, venues that do not disclose their type of business as well as venues in Europe, North America and Oceania increase crypto volatility.

7167,does zinc deficiency lead to depression?,Zinc regulation of adult stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the rat dentate gyrus,"Dietary zinc deficiency leads to the development of depression‐ and anxiety‐like behaviors in adult rats. Zinc deficient (ZD) rats displayed anorexia, anhedonia (reduced saccharin:water intake, p<0.001), and decreased exploratory behavior in a light‐dark box test (p<0.05). The antidepressant drug fluoxetine (10mg/kg body wt), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reduced behavioral despair, as measured by the forced swim test, in zinc adequate (ZA), but not ZD rats (p<0.002). Thus, it appears that ZD not only induces depression, but also impairs the efficacy of antidepressant drugs. Because it is known that fluoxetine action is dependent on stem cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus, we hypothesized that low zinc status impairs proliferation in this region of the limbic system. Following 3 wk of zinc‐adequate (ZA, 30 ppm), zinc‐deficient (ZD, 1 ppm), pair‐fed (PF, 30 ppm), or zinc‐supplemented (ZS, 100 ppm) diets, immunohistochemistry was used to quantify the number of Ki67 positive cells as a measure of newly proliferated cells in the dentate. Neurogenesis was determined by the co‐localization of the early neuronal marker, NeuN, with Ki67. Zinc deficiency reduced the number of Ki67 positive cells to 25% of ZA controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, the ZS diet appeared to increase neuronal differentiation. Together, these data suggest that ZD impairs neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in the dentate leading to behaviors consistent with depression in adult rats, and limiting the efficacy of antidepressant drugs.",Zinc deficiency leads to depression-like behaviors in adult rats and impairs the efficacy of antidepressant drugs.,question,1565,114.0
7872,effect of urbanization on development,Urbanization and Social Change in West Africa,"This book is one of a series on urbanization in developing countries intended for undergraduate and graduate students and general readers. It reviews and draws inferences from research in history, anthropology, sociology, geography, demography, and social psychology. In addition, the authors have incorporated into most chapters a selection from the work of another scholar, including several Nigerian writers. By dedicating the book ""to the future of Guinea-Bissau"" and its socialist efforts, Gugler and Flanagan highlight the concern which permeates their work—social equity and especially the allocation of resources to rural populations, as well as urban elites, to achieve truly national development. They begin with a historical overview of urban development in West Africa, going back to the tenth century, examining the importance of trade and external connections, the links between urban and rural life, and speculations on the causes of the rise and decline of urban societies. In the second chapter, they draw attentin to their main theme in analyzing the relationships between contemporary economic development and urbanization. Discussing over-urbanization, the authors conclude hat because of urban unemployment and underemployment the growth of cities is not adding qualitatively or quantitatively to national economic development. Using housing as an example, they review the indadequacies of attempts to solve urban problems, and suggest that the political processes are biased towards the interests of a small group of decision-makers. They urge increased attention to intermediate-sized cities, the full range of urban populations, and the rural masses. Despite the difficulties of obtaining urban employment, rural Africans continue to migrate to cities at a rapid rate. Gugler and Flanagan describe motivations for migration and conclude that the decision to migrate is a rational one for the migrant, conferring benefits in income, services, training opportunites, and lower infant mortality. Most of the evidence is qualitative, perhaps reflecting the available policies to stem present trends of marginalization of parts of the rural population and some rural regions would require more detailed and quantitative understanding of the magnitude and origins of migration flows. Throughout the book the authors show the kinds of links which exist between rural and urban people, cutting across class lines and contributing to social welfare. They describe ways in which urban residents assist migrants, contribute to the support of their rural relatives, and rely on the rural homeland for","Urbanization in West Africa leads to unemployment and underemployment, hindering national economic development.",phrase,2612,111.0
10052,Is marijuana safe for use by children?,Is Cannabis Legalization Eliciting Abusive Behaviors in Parents? A Case Report.,"The interest in cannabis, cannabis-based compounds, and treatments is rapidly growing along with the legalization of marijuana in many countries and widespread use of cannabis derivatives in medical products. A growing body of literature is warning about possible unintentional intoxication in children because of unregulated and unsupervised use of cannabinoids by parents; to our knowledge, very rarely have parental self-prescription and self-administration to their children (affected by neurologic or other disorders or no disorders at all) been reported. We report a 4-year-old child, suffering from an anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis, who was found unpredictably positive for cannabis and other illicit substances after drug testing was performed in order to investigate the child's treatment-resistant behavioral disturbances. Toxicologic analyses were also extended to the child's parents, who finally disclosed that they had deliberately administered a cannabis-derived product (cannabidiol extract) as a home remedy for managing their child's behavior. Careless with regard to the possible adverse effects and certain that the product was legal, they presumed there was no need for them to inform the physicians in charge of treating the child of this practice.","Parents' unsupervised use of cannabinoids can lead to unintentional intoxication in children, causing treatment-resistant behavioral disturbances.",question,1288,146.0
2212,what is the best way to restore plants for conservation,Evaluation of an Organic Package of Practice Towards Green Gram Cultivation and Assessment of its Effectiveness in Terms of Crop Sustainability and Soil Quality Development,"Restoration of soil has been identified as the option; to ensure crop sustainability. However, as per Trophobiosis Theory of French Scientist F. Chaboussou, focus on development of healthy plants is necessary to abate pest and disease invasion so as to ensure sustained crop performance, even under unfavorable environmental conditions. The present study, in randomized block design with green gram as test crop; was undertaken in Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Howrah, West Bengal) to evaluate the effectiveness of Inhana Rational Farming (IRF) Technology towards crop yield and soil quality development under different sustainable models viz. organic cultivation, integrated soil with organic crop management and non- chemical crop management; as compared to conventional farming practice. Highest yield was recorded under organic (933 kg ha-1) followed by integrated (921 kg ha-1) and non- chemical plant management (902 kg ha-1). The results were well corroborated with the plant development index obtained under these treatments. Favorable trend of soil quality under sustainable models especially in terms of microbial properties indicated the role of quality compost towards speedy rejuvenation of soil dynamics. The study indicated that reduction of synthetic fertilizers and qualitative management of soil is essential to restrict yield decline. However, plant management shall be prerequisite for ensuring crop sustainability without any time lag and under the changing climatic patterns. In this respect the potential of IRF Technology has been well accounted.","Organic cultivation, integrated soil with organic crop management, and non-chemical plant management can improve crop yield and soil quality for plant conservation.",question,1562,164.0
7889,what is encoding in psychology,An Archetypal Mental Coding Process,"This paper presents evidence for a psychological coding process that meets the criteria that define such processes in organic nature and culture. The recognition of these previously unknown encoding sequences is derived from the recent formulation of an adaptive mental module of the mind—the emotion processing mind—that has evolved to cope with traumatic events and the unique, language derived, explicit human awareness of personal mortality. The emergent awareness of death has served as a selection factor for the evolution of a two-system, emotion-processing mind, with conscious and unconscious components, an arrangement that allows for the invocation of conscious denial, which in turn has fostered the use of encoding when faced with death-related traumas. The paper offers several ways in which evolved mental adaptations have features that are shared with those that are biological. Many aspects of these mental adaptive efforts are comparable to attempts at defense that are carried out by the immune system. In addition, the adaptive approach has been the foundation for the discovery of laws of communication, and thus of the mind, that are on a parallel with those found through mathematical models drawn from Newtonian physics.","Encoding in psychology refers to a process that allows for conscious denial and is used when faced with death-related traumas, as part of the emotion-processing mind.",question,1244,166.0

There are no items in common between the two scales, and they correlate -.10 with each other for both men and women. Distributional, temporal stability, and internal consistency characteristics were analyzed, as well as their item overlap and correlations with the basic profile scales. These separate unipolar scales were contrasted with Scale 5 (the Masculinity-Femininity scale, Mf), the traditional measure of these constructs in the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI).

The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD. In this analysis article we describe shortly the evidence in the field, an application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised to the application and the WHO Expert Committee’s decision. The application of getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overzealous in reporting potential benefits, without highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions encompassing medicines candidate to the WHO Model List should not be based on speculation about potential benefits and should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties. Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning the benefits of this medication in children, adolescents and adults with ADHD is uncertain. The decision of the committee was to not include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines ‘due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit, and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm’.","The benefits of methylphenidate for ADHD are uncertain, with concerns regarding the quality and limitations of available evidence for both benefit and harm.",question,1332,156.0
17270,the impact of regulatory privilages on market power of firms,Oligopoly under incomplete information: On the welfare effects of price discrimination,"Abstract We study competition by firms that simultaneously post (potentially nonlinear) tariffs to consumers who are privately informed about their tastes. Market power stems from informational frictions, in that consumers are heterogeneously informed about firms’ offers. In the absence of regulation, all firms offer quantity discounts. As a result, relative to Bertrand pricing, imperfect competition benefits disproportionately more consumers whose willingness to pay is high, rather than low. Regulation imposing linear pricing hurts the former but benefits the latter consumers. While consumer surplus increases, firms’ profits decrease, enough to drive down utilitarian welfare. By contrast, improvements in market transparency increase utilitarian welfare, and achieve similar gains on consumer surplus as imposing linear pricing, although with limited distributive impact. On normative grounds, our analysis suggests that banning price discrimination is warranted only if its distributive benefits have a weight on the societal objective.","Regulation imposing linear pricing increases consumer surplus but decreases firms' profits, leading to a decrease in utilitarian welfare.",phrase,1047,137.0

20824,what are the factors that influence the issuance of sukuk?,Perkembangan Dan Dinamika Pasar Sukuk Domestik: Sebuah Kajian Agenda Dan Kebijakan,"One of Islamic financial sectors that attract much interest from the business community around the world is the global sharia obligation (sukuk) market. Sukuk has become an important instrument in sharia financial system, both as a financing instrument and investment. This instrument grew rapidly along with the growth and development of other conventional financial instruments. This estimation is based on the large number of infrastructure projects from the Gulf region and across the Muslim world seeking capital for development. This paper tries to answer the question: What are the factors that led to the issuance and development of sukuk in three countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, and Turkey? The result shows that government policy and agenda in order to develop sukuk can be concluded that the issuance of sukuk from three countries Indonesia, Malaysia and Turkey is influenced by several factors. However, the most dominant factor, even the factor that has always been the cause of the increased issuance of sukuk in three countries is the regulatory or policy factor, especially regarding the tax on sukuk and the existence of strong legal infrastructure as an umbrella of sukuk practice in a country. It can be said that the smaller the tax on the issuance of sukuk the more sukuk will be published. Then the second element of the regulatory factor is the existence of security guarantees in its implementation from the side of positive law imposed in a State. This factor is also very important especially in cases in Indonesia. With the legal clarity, there is no slit in the weakness of sukuk when compared with bonds. It is different from the two countries above, the advancement of sukuk issuance apart from being influenced by regulatory factors, Malaysia seems to be more benefited by the perception of the global community that Malaysia has become the Islamic economic and finance center in the world, so Malaysia is considered more experienced in this sector. This is a factor that may be considered by global investors, so that Malaysia is to be the right destination for sharia-based investment.

The present study, however, approached the problem of pinpointing the variables which are most relevant to unguided decision making behavior. A factor analysis was done of a battery of 70 scores which included a wide sample of decision-making behavior and certain cognitive and personality measures. The decision behavior was obtained in a variety of laboratory tasks designed to measure different traits. The cognitive and personality measures were included to help clarify the behavior represented by each factor. Eight oblique, but nearly orthogonal, factors were obtained: (1) readiness to make distinctive or informationally more certain responses, (2) intellectual passivity, (3) rational, active approach to new problems, (4) formation of sound concepts, combined, in decision making, with mimicry of the outcomes of prior events, (5) pessimism, with unstructured or global responses, (6) constrictive rigidity when required to make too many decisions in a short time, (7) consideration of each decision element independently, with active search for information and (8) contemplative appreciation of the structure of events.","Eight factors relevant to decision making are: readiness to respond, intellectual passivity, rational approach, concept formation, pessimism, rigidity, independent consideration, and contemplation.",question,1285,197.0
13691,how does unpaid care work affect the gender wage gap?,Occupational Career Change and Gender Wage Inequality,"This article examines the relationship between the changing occupational careers of female wage earners and gender wage inequality. Using Current Population Survey-Merged Outgoing Rotation Group data, it assesses the effect on the gender wage gap of changes in the composition and price both of care-providing occupations that are culturally associated with female labor and of managerial and professional occupations that are not part of the care economy, over the period 1979 to 2015. It finds that the rapid entry of female workers into high-wage managerial occupations, and their exit from low-wage private household work, contributed to gender wage convergence. However, the wage-equalizing effects of occupational shifts and related behavioral changes diminish over time, and wage convergence ceases after 2007. It also finds that female workers continue to be disadvantaged by wage dispersion and that most of the remaining gender wage gap arises within occupations.

We aimed to determine the factors associated with HRV and evaluate the association between low HRV and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: A 10-second electrocardiogram was obtained at baseline in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. HRV was measured by the standard deviation of all R-R intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences between R-R intervals (RMSSD). Results: In 3,245 CRIC participants with available baseline SDNN and RMSSD, lower HRV was associated with older age, lack of exercise, heart failure, elevated phosphorus and hemoglobin A1c, and low estimated glomerular filtration rate. After a median follow-up of 4.2 years, in fully adjusted models, lower HRV was not associated with renal [SDNN: hazard rate, HR = 0.96 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.88-1.05); RMSSD: HR = 0.97 (95% CI 0.88-1.07)] or cardiovascular outcomes [SDNN: HR = 1.02 (95% CI 0.92-1.13); RMSSD: HR = 1.00 (95% CI 0.90-1.10)]. There was a nonlinear relationship between RMSSD and all-cause mortality with increased risk with both low and high RMSSD (p = 0.04). Conclusions: In a large cohort of patients with CKD, multiple risk factors for renal and cardiovascular diseases were associated with lower HRV. Lower HRV was not associated with increased risk for renal or cardiovascular outcomes, but both low and high RMSSD were associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality.

8169,impact of invasive plants on native ecosystems and agriculture,Invasive Spartina alterniflora in controlled cultivation: Environmental implications of converging future technologies,"Abstract Invasive species have become a major threat to ecosystem stability, diversity and sustainability in recent times. Invasive plants such as Spartina alterniflora (SA), outgrow resident flora by rapidly utilizing essential soil nutrients depriving the native plant species, impacting the ecosystem diversity and stability. SA is also notorious for its effect on local biodiversity as it grows and spreads faster, ultimately dominating local biodiversity. This dominance and the negative effect of invasive SA is due to features such as allochemical’s secretion, positive feedback between plant and soil, and rapid absorption of soil nutrients, exerting a competitive advantage over native plants. Therefore, in this review, we aim to contemplate the implications and potential applications of SA under control conditions or special circumstances as a source of biomass, soil restorer, CO2 capture agent, soil resilience enhancer and pollution remover as most of the studies on SA have focused on controlling its impact on the local ecosystem. On the other hand, SA's ability to grow quickly in poor alkaline soils is useful but very little is explored to exploit SA for biomass production in controlled cultivation in different environmental conditions. In addition to these aspects, the CO2 sequestration capability requires greater focus, especially in sensitive salt marshes and wetlands along the coastal areas.","Invasive plants like Spartina alterniflora outgrow native flora, depriving them of essential soil nutrients and negatively impacting ecosystem diversity and stability.",phrase,1421,167.0

With a team climate perspective, this paper investigates the impact of the team leader’s conflict management style on team innovation performance in remote R&D teams in China based on social cognition theory and two-dimension theory. A theoretical model is constructed which describes the mediating effect of team psychological safety and the moderating impact of team trust. Paired data from 118 remote R&D teams in China including 118 leaders and 446 members were collected. The results show that team leader’s cooperative conflict management style is conducive to enhancing team psychological safety and further effectively improves team innovation performance. Therefore, team psychological safety has a mediating effect between team leader’s cooperative conflict management style and team innovation performance. In addition, team trust has a negative moderating effect between team leader’s cooperative conflict management style and team psychological safety. Besides, this study obtains some valuable culture-related insights and provides more views for conflict management research in the cross-cultural context since the samples in this study are from China, a society with high collectivism, which is different from the western cultural context from which many conflict management theories develop.","A team leader's cooperative conflict management style enhances team psychological safety, which in turn improves team innovation performance.",question,1520,141.0

We aimed to assess the impact of stevia supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Also, we aimed to examine the association between stevia supplementation and anthropometric measures as well as lipid profile in both obese and diabetic patients. Patients and methods The controlled clinical trial included unrelated 150 participants; 40 patients with T2DM and 60 obese patients and 50 healthy controls. Obese patients were then subdivided into two subgroups according to their fasting blood sugar: nondiabetic (n=30) and 30 patients with T2DM. The participants received stevia (4 mg/kg/body weight) as an alternative to artificial sweetener for 24 weeks. Results Our results found that stevioside supplementation for diabetic patients’ increased the total caloric intake and decreased BMI, waist circumference, waist–hip ratio, and fat mass index, in the obese group. Our results have shown a significant increase of BMI, waist circumference, waist–hip ratio, and fat mass index after 24 weeks of stevia supplementation. In the diabetic group, stevioside for 24 weeks improved the lipid profile and glycemic control, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as well as total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in all studied intervention groups. Logistic regression test revealed that among clinical and laboratory waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were independent predictors of response to stevioside. Conclusion Stevioside supplementations for 24 weeks improved cardiometabolic risk in diabetic patients. However, in the obese group, stevioside supplementations increased body weight.",Stevioside supplementation for 24 weeks improved glycemic control and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes patients.,question,1960,112.0
5295,what are the health effects of a low HRV?,Acute effect of ambient fine particulate matter on heart rate variability: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of panel studies,"Background Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is a predictor of autonomic system dysfunction, and is considered as a potential mechanism of increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) induced by exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM 2.5 ). Previous studies have suggested that exposure to PM 2.5 may lead to decreased HRV levels, but the results remain inconsistent. Methods An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of panel studies till November 1, 2019 was conducted to evaluate the acute effect of exposure to ambient PM 2.5 on HRV. We searched electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) to identify panel studies reporting the associations between exposure to PM 2.5 and the four indicators of HRV (standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences in adjacent normal-to-normal intervals (rMSSD), high frequency power (HF), and low frequency power (LF)). Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates. Results A total of 33 panel studies were included in our meta-analysis, with 16 studies conducted in North America, 12 studies in Asia, and 5 studies in Europe. The pooled results showed a 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure which was significantly associated with a − 0.92% change in SDNN (95% confidence intervals (95%CI) − 1.26%, − 0.59%), − 1.47% change in rMSSD (95%CI − 2.17%, − 0.77%), − 2.17% change in HF (95%CI − 3.24%, − 1.10%), and − 1.52% change in LF (95%CI − 2.50%, − 0.54%), respectively. Overall, subgroup analysis suggested that short-term exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with lower HRV levels in Asians, healthy population, and those aged ≥ 40 years. Conclusion Short-term exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with decreased HRV levels. Future studies are warranted to clarity the exact mechanism of exposure to PM 2.5 on the cardiovascular system through disturbance of autonomic nervous function.","Decreased HRV levels are associated with short-term exposure to PM 2.5, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.",question,1957,126.0
18842,does fish oil fail to improve cardiovascular health?,Dietary pre‐exposure of rats to fish oil does not enhance myocardial efficiency of isolated working hearts or their left ventricular trabeculae,"Dietary fish oil has been found to have protective effects against cardiovascular disease, particularly in its role as an anti‐arrhythmic agent. An additional mechanism proposed for the putative cardio‐protective effect is enhanced efficiency of metabolic energy usage by the heart. We tested whether dietary supplementation of fish oil enhances cardiac efficiency or otherwise improves mechano‐energetic performance. Experiments were performed at two distinct physiological levels (whole organ and isolated tissues) employing two independent metabolic indices (oxygen consumption and heat production), respectively.

9071,why mosaicism percentage is different in placenta and amniotic fluid,Noninvasive prenatal testing as compared to chorionic villus sampling is more sensitive for the detection of confined placental mosaicism involving the cytotrophoblast,"Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) is defined as a chromosomally abnormal cell line restricted to the placenta, while the fetus is chromosomally normal. It was first described in 1983 in term placentae. CPM can prenatally be detected by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or by noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free (cf) DNA. NIPT investigates DNA released from the cytotrophoblast (CTB) in maternal blood plasma. CPM is now recognized as the major origin of discordant NIPT results. Little is known about the sensitivity of NIPT for detection of CPM. Brison et al (2018) found evidence that NIPT is more sensitive for the detection of placental mosaicism due to the observation of a higher proportion of mosaicism for the common aneuploidies with NIPT as compared to conventional karyotyping. In contrast, Benn et al showed a significantly lower sensitivity for the detection of rare autosomal aneuploidies (RATs), mostly involved in CPM, for NIPT (0.32%) vs CVS (0.41%). The use of study cohorts with probably different a priori risk figures for CPM, may explain the conflicting results of both studies. Moreover, whereas placental studies shed some light on the correlation between cytogenetic results of CVS and those from term placentae, little is known about how cytogenetic results of NIPT relate to those from CVS and placenta. Papers on placental cytogenetic studies after NIPT are rare and amniocentesis is generally the preferred technique for confirmatory diagnostic testing after an abnormal NIPT result. Potential detection of chromosomal mosaicism in CV, which may require an undesired second invasive procedure for clarification of the fetal karyotype, may discredit CVS. However, if both cell layers of CV (CTB and mesenchymal core [MC]) are investigated separately, thus enabling differentiation between their respective chromosomal constitution, the risk of a confirmatory amniocentesis after CVS is predicted to be low for the common trisomies (eg, trisomy 21 (2%), trisomy 18 (4%), and trisomy 13 (8%22%)). On the contrary, if NIPT indicates another trisomy, CPM is the most likely reason for this result. In such cases CVS for confirmation is only recommended for RATs that are mostly involved in CPM type 1, like trisomy 3, 7, 8, 9, 20. In all other cases, amniocentesis is indeed the preferred confirmatory test. Hence little is known about the representation of the placental chromosomal constitution in the cfDNA fraction in cases of CPM and about the sensitivity of NIPT to detect it. It is assumed that the entire placental trophoblast sheds cfDNA into the maternal circulation and that a CPM restricted to smaller placental areas may be detected by NIPT and missed by CVS. However, as far as we know, there are no studies comparing NIPT, CVS and placenta cytogenetic data. Based on four cases with normal CVS results after genome-wide (gw) NIPT revealed a RAT, we show evidence that NIPT is better able to detect (low-level) placental mosaicism involving the cytotrophoblast than CVS.

9385,does antiperspirant cause cancer?,Effects of aluminium chloride and aluminium chlorohydrate on DNA repair in MCF10A immortalised non-transformed human breast epithelial cells.,"Use of underarm aluminium (Al)-based antiperspirant salts may be a contributory factor in breast cancer development. At the 10th Keele meeting, Al was reported to cause anchorage-independent growth and double strand DNA breaks in MCF10A immortalised non-transformed human breast epithelial cells. We now report that exposure of MCF10A cells to Al chloride or Al chlorohydrate also compromised DNA repair systems. Long-term (19-21 weeks) exposure to Al chloride or Al chlorohydrate at a 10(-4) M concentration resulted in reduced levels of BRCA1 mRNA as determined by real-time RT-PCR and BRCA1 protein as determined by Western immunoblotting. Reduced levels of mRNA for other DNA repair genes (BRCA2, CHK1, CHK2, Rad51, ATR) were also observed using real-time RT-PCR. Loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene function has long been associated with inherited susceptibility to breast cancer but these results suggest that exposure to aluminium-based antiperspirant salts may also reduce levels of these key components of DNA repair in breast epithelial cells. If Al can not only damage DNA but also compromise DNA repair systems, then there is the potential for Al to impact on breast carcinogenesis.","Exposure to aluminum-based antiperspirant salts may reduce levels of key components of DNA repair in breast epithelial cells, potentially impacting breast carcinogenesis.",question,1186,170.0
19460,relationship between lighting and gloss perception,The influence of the illumination geometry and luminance contrast on gloss perception,"Gloss is a main characteristic determining the appearance of objects. Physically, gloss results from directionally selective light scattering at the front surface of a material, with a preference towards the specular reflection direction. However, the sample illuminance and consequently the entire luminance distribution of the illumination scene around the sample could strongly influence gloss perception, especially for high glossy surfaces on which a reflected image becomes perceptible. In this study, the influence of variations in illumination conditions and engendered luminance contrasts on gloss perception has been examined. A psychophysical experiment was conducted in a light booth, especially designed for this purpose. The final outcome of the study is a psychophysical scaling function, relating visual gloss to the luminance of both the reflected image and the surround.","Gloss perception is influenced by variations in illumination conditions and luminance contrasts, as shown by a psychophysical scaling function.",phrase,888,143.0
9022,why predators are spatially disperse?,Effect of non-random dispersal strategies on spatial coexistence mechanisms.,"1. Random dispersal leads to spatial coexistence via two mechanisms (emigration-mediated and source-sink), both of which involve the movement of organisms from areas of higher to lower fitness. What is not known is whether such coexistence would occur if organisms dispersed non-randomly, using cues such as density and habitat quality to gauge fitness differences between habitats. Here, I conduct a comparative analysis of random and non-random dispersal strategies in a foodweb with a basal resource, top predator, and two intermediate consumers that exhibit a trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility. 2. I find a striking contrast between density- and habitat-dependent dispersal in their effects on spatial coexistence. Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates coexistence while dispersal in response to habitat quality (resource productivity and predator pressure) inhibits it. Moreover, density-dependent dispersal changes species' distribution patterns from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation, while habitat-dependent dispersal preserves the interspecific segregation observed in the absence of dispersal. Under density-dependent dispersal, widespread spatial coexistence results in an overall decline in the abundance of the inferior competitor that is less susceptible to predation and an overall increase in the abundance of the superior competitor that is more susceptible to predation. Under habitat-dependent dispersal, restricted spatial coexistence results in species' abundances being essentially unchanged from those observed in the absence of dispersal. 3. A key outcome is that when the superior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the inferior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is possible in both resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. However, when the inferior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the superior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is precluded in resource-poor habitats and greatly reduced in resource-rich habitats. This suggests that species-specific differences may play an important role in driving spatial coexistence patterns. 4. The comparative framework yields predictions that can be tested with experiments that manipulate the relative mobilities of interacting species, or observational data on relative abundances and distribution patterns.","Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates spatial coexistence, while dispersal in response to habitat quality inhibits it.",question,2428,149.0
20956,what impacts heart rate variability?,Heart rate variability analysis.,"The expansion of heart rate variability analysis has been facilitated by the remarkable development of computer sciences and digital signal processing during the last thirty years. The beat-to-beat fluctuation of the heart rate originates from the momentary summing of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the sinus node. According to the extensive associations of the autonomic nervous system, several factors affect heart rate and its variability such as posture, respiration frequency, age, gender, physical or mental load, pain, numerous disease conditions, and different drugs. Heart rate variability can be quantitatively measured by time domain and frequency domain methods that are detailed in the paper. Non-linear methods have not spread in the clinical practice yet. Various cardiovascular and other pathologies as well as different forms of mental and physical load are associated with altered heart rate variability offering the possibility of predicting disease outcome and assessing stress.","Factors affecting heart rate variability include posture, respiration frequency, age, gender, physical or mental load, pain, disease conditions, and different drugs.",question,1014,165.0
6141,why are people not happier?,Self-Compassion and Happiness: Exploring the Influence of the Subcomponents of Self-Compassion on Happiness and Vice Versa.,"Self-compassion is a healthy conceptualization of the self and has been associated with a myriad of health benefits. There is limited research regarding the influence of the subcomponents of self-compassion on happiness and vice versa. This study investigated (1) the influence and relative strength of the relationships of the 6 subcomponents of self-compassion onto happiness, (2) the influence and relative strength of the relationships of happiness onto the 6 subcomponents of self-compassion and (3) the bi-directional relationship between total self-compassion variables and happiness across two timepoints. This study followed a pre-post design whereby 33 university students and employees undergoing a physical activity counselling (PAC) program filled out validated online questionnaires before and immediately after individualized sessions. Results revealed that there was a positive bi-directional relationship between self-compassion and happiness over time, with the stronger influence being from happiness to self-compassion. This is likely because happier individuals are kinder to themselves and strongly connected with others. Moreover, results showed that mindfulness was the strongest subcomponent of self-compassion to positively influence happiness, and happiness was the strongest negative predictor of isolation. This has practical implications in that PAC counsellors and other practitioners should try to emphasize mindfulness in their interventions to maximize feelings of happiness, and try to cultivate happiness to reduce feelings of isolation and increase total self-compassion.","Lack of self-compassion, particularly mindfulness, may contribute to people not being happier, as it positively influences happiness and reduces feelings of isolation.",question,1608,167.0
15107,Does Vitamin D help with depression?,The use of vitamin D in depression,"Vitamin D has increasingly been associated with the pathophysiology of mental illness and has been suggested to have beneficial effects on depression in adults. Epidemiological studies concerning vitamin D and depression have found inconsistent results and many have significant methodological limitations. The available evidence suggests that depressed individuals show reduced vitamin D concentrations compared to controls without depression. Despite the available findings suggesting that hypovitaminosis D elevates the risk of depressive mood, the evidence of observational and interventional studies is insufficient to establish causality between low vitamin D levels and the occurrence of depression. The question of whether vitamin D sufficiency has protective efficacy against incident depression or recurrence requires future investigation. In order to examine the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D, further well-designed, large-scale, long-term intervention trials of vitamin D supplementation in people of different age groups with depressive symptoms, diagnosed depression, postpartum depression or other depressive disorders are warranted. In short, current evidence cannot definitively establish whether vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor in the development of depression or whether vitamin D is effective in the treatment of depression.",Current evidence cannot definitively establish whether vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor in the development of depression or if it is effective in its treatment.,question,1354,165.0
12718,does hypnosis enhance neuroplasticity,Neural functional correlates of hypnosis and hypnoanalgesia: Role of the cingulate cortex,"ABSTRACT Hypnosis is a hetero-induced or self-induced altered state of consciousness that involves focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness. It is determined by response to suggestions and can be used in the management of various clinical conditions. Nowadays there is growing attention to the neurobiological correlates of hypnosis because of its future clinical applications. The greater attention is due to the wide range of applications that might stem from its knowledge. Functional neuroimaging studies show that hypnosis affects attention by modulating the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and other brain areas, modifying the conflict monitoring and cognitive control. During hypnoanalgesia, several changes in brain functions occur in all the areas of the pain network, and other brain areas. Among these, the anterior cingulate cortex is significantly involved in modulating the activity of pain circuits under hypnosis, both in the affective, sensory-cognitive, and behavioral aspects. The study of the functionality of the cingulate cortices, mainly the anterior and medial portions, appears to be crucial for better understanding the hypnotic phenomena, related to both the neurocognitive and somatosensory aspects.","Hypnosis affects attention by modulating the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and other brain areas, modifying conflict monitoring and cognitive control.",question,1249,164.0
476,how high is the cancer risk from aspartame?,"Aspartame: A Safety Evaluation Based on Current Use Levels, Regulations, and Toxicological and Epidemiological Studies","Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide used as a synthetic nonnutritive sweetener in over 90 countries worldwide in over 6000 products. The purpose of this investigation was to review the scientific literature on the absorption and metabolism, the current consumption levels worldwide, the toxicology, and recent epidemiological studies on aspartame. Current use levels of aspartame, even by high users in special subgroups, remains well below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority established acceptable daily intake levels of 50 and 40 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Consumption of large doses of aspartame in a single bolus dose will have an effect on some biochemical parameters, including plasma amino acid levels and brain neurotransmitter levels. The rise in plasma levels of phenylalanine and aspartic acid following administration of aspartame at doses less than or equal to 50 mg/kg bw do not exceed those observed postprandially. Acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies with aspartame, and its decomposition products, conducted in mice, rats, hamsters and dogs have consistently found no adverse effect of aspartame with doses up to at least 4000 mg/kg bw/day. Critical review of all carcinogenicity studies conducted on aspartame found no credible evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic. The data from the extensive investigations into the possibility of neurotoxic effects of aspartame, in general, do not support the hypothesis that aspartame in the human diet will affect nervous system function, learning or behavior. Epidemiological studies on aspartame include several case-control studies and one well-conducted prospective epidemiological study with a large cohort, in which the consumption of aspartame was measured. The studies provide no evidence to support an association between aspartame and cancer in any tissue.

6858,can zinc help treat depression?,Dietary zinc intake and the risk of depression in middle-aged men: a 20-year prospective follow-up study.,"BACKGROUND
Zinc is an immunomodulatory trace element suggested to be beneficial in the augmentation of antidepressant therapy. Cross-sectional studies have also suggested an association between low dietary zinc and depression. This study examined the association between dietary zinc intake and depression in a prospective setting in initially depression-free men during a 20-year follow-up.


METHODS
The study formed a part of the population-based Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, and comprised 2317 Finnish men aged 42-61 years. Zinc intake was assessed at baseline by a 4-d food record. Baseline depression severity was recorded with the Human Population Laboratory Depression Scale. In the prospective setting, depression was defined as having received a hospital discharge diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder. Individuals who at baseline had elevated depressive symptoms were excluded (n=283).


RESULTS
Altogether, 60 (2.7%) individuals received a hospital discharge diagnosis of depression during the 20-year follow-up. In Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, baseline depression severity, smoking, alcohol use, physical exercise and the use of dietary supplements, belonging to the lowest tertile of energy-adjusted zinc intake was not associated with an increased depression risk (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.59-1.90).


LIMITATIONS
These observations may not be generalizable to women, or to individuals with a depression level not warranting hospitalization.

In the absence of comparison, all scientific inquiry and investigation is meaningless. Comparison has a significant history in the study of human science, history, and culture. Comparative study in the subject of social theory may be seen since ancient Greek, and this unbroken history was only strengthened as time has elapsed. Comparison research is a process of determining and quantifying correlations between two or more variables by studying various groups that are subjected to various treatments, either by decision or by circumstances. A comparative analysis compares two or more similar groups, individuals, or conditions to arrive at a conclusion. Due to the result of ongoing processes such as the massive expansion in telecommunications, technical breakthroughs, and the inherent amplification of globalization trends, comparative research, particularly cross-national comparison, has received much interest lately. As a result, instances of comparative techniques may be found throughout the modern social sciences, health sciences, and humanities. Researchers have compared cases to each other, use statistical techniques to establish quantitative comparisons, compare cases to theoretically produce results, and compare case values on important factors to actual rates to examine co-variation.","Comparative research helps determine and quantify correlations between variables by studying various groups, making it valuable in fields like social sciences, health sciences, and humanities.",phrase,1372,192.0

The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of intellectual capital on a firm’s absorptive capacity (ACAP), and of ACAP on product innovation. The authors argue that intellectual capital and other sets of intangible assets are mobilized by firms through dynamic capabilities such as ACAP. Product innovation is one of the results of this process. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A quantitative study was conducted, including 500 firms of different sizes, industries and technological intensities located in southern Brazil. The validity of constructs and the theoretical model were confirmed by structural equation modeling. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The authors found that intellectual capital does influence ACAP, albeit differently on each of ACAP’s dimensions. Acquisition, assimilation and exploitation of knowledge are more decisively influenced by structural capital, followed by human capital. The ability of transformation of knowledge is evenly influenced by structural and human capital, and more moderately so by social capital. The results also showed that ACAP influences product innovation, but each of its dimensions demonstrated a different impact. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
This study helps practitioners to identify the development of a firm’s intangible resources and its influences on product innovation. This characterization can serve as a benchmark for managers or private and public companies to define strategies and policies to stimulate innovation.

9094,how muscle build by leucine?,Safety and Tolerability of Leucine Supplementation in Elderly Men.,"Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and has been suggested to play a role in the prevention of age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia). Although leucine supplementation may be beneficial, the efficacious dose of leucine is unknown. Before conducting studies with increased doses of leucine, the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for leucine needs to be determined. The objective of this review is to describe 2 current studies to determine the UL for leucine in young and elderly men. Initially, in young men we tested the conceptual model of determining the maximum oxidative capacity of an amino acid to be an ideal marker for identifying the UL. Leucine oxidation, measured with the use of l-[1-13C]leucine, increased with increasing leucine intakes and reached a plateau at higher intakes. Two-phase linear regression analysis identified a breakpoint of 550 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1 (95% CI: 454, 646 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1), with a simultaneous increase in blood ammonia concentrations above normal values (35 μmol/L). Recently, a similar study was conducted in elderly men (∼72 y old). A breakpoint in leucine oxidation was observed at 431 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1 (95% CI: 351, 511 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1), with blood ammonia concentrations above normal (35 μmol/L) at leucine intakes >550 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1 Taking the data together, the UL for leucine intake in healthy elderly men could be set at a value similar to young men, at 500 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1, or ∼35 g/d for an individual weighing 70 kg; or, as a cautious estimate, the leucine UL could also be considered as 351 mg ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ d-1 (the lower 95% CI), which would be ∼24.5 g/d for an elderly individual weighing 70 kg. These studies to determine the UL for leucine in humans are acute diet studies, and future studies with additional biomarkers and long-term supplementation of leucine will be necessary.","Leucine stimulates muscle protein synthesis, potentially preventing age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia).",question,1889,108.0
11848,why adolescents have mental problems,Adolescents’ adverse experiences and mental health in a prospective perspective,"Aims: The aim of this study is to examine the possible changes in depressive symptoms related to various adverse experiences, based on a three-year follow-up among adolescents. Methods: All 10th graders invited to enter the youth section of the Oslo Health Study 2001 (n = 3,811) constituted a baseline of a longitudinal study. A high level of mental distress (Hscl-10 score ≥1.85) according to the different life experiences was compared, at baseline (15 years) and follow-up (18 years). Results: All adverse experiences were associated with a high Hscl-10 score except parents not living together and death of a close person at 15 and 18 years for boys, and death of a close person at 18 years of age for girls. A development from high Hscl-10 score at baseline to low score at follow up was defined as recovery from mental distress. The proportion of the youth that had a high Hscl-10 score related to reporting adverse life experiences at age 15, followed by a low Hscl-10 score three years later proved to be between 44% and 89% among boys and between 16% and 31% among girls. Conclusions: From a three year longitudinal perspective the recovery from mental distress is substantial and higher among boys than among girls. However, mental distress seems to persist in a considerable proportion of the adolescents. Consequently, it is insufficient to brush aside traumas and hurt and rely on a time healing process only.","Adverse experiences are associated with high mental distress in adolescents, and recovery from mental distress is higher among boys than girls.",question,1423,143.0
8928,is it possible for people to change their political views later on in life?,Political Socialization and the Future of Politics,"It is clear that generational replacement is one of the main driving forces for social and political change in liberal democracies. While there is considerable consensus about the observation that the political attitudes and behaviors of young people differ significantly from those of earlier cohorts, there is disagreement about how this observation should be interpreted. Some authors worry about the decline of participation and trust among young people; others herald their tolerance and critical attitudes. In this introduction, it is argued that, because of this generational replacement mechanism, youth studies offer us a glimpse of the future evolution of western political systems. If the differences that are currently being observed persist into later parts of the life cycle, this implies that political systems will have to find a way to adapt to a more critical and distant citizenry.",Generational replacement is a main driving force for social and political change.,question,900,81.0
15650,what kind education system does america uses and why?,Social Class in Public Schools,"This article shows the pattern of socioeconomic class differences in schooling outcomes and indicates some of the causes for those differences that lie within the public realm. Those causes include “nested inequalities” across boundaries of states, school districts, schools within a district, classes within a school, and sometimes separation within a class. In addition, urban public schools demonstrate a particular set of problems that generate differential schooling outcomes by economic class. The article also demonstrates ways in which class biases are closely entwined with racial and ethnic inequities. It concludes with the broad outlines of what would be necessary to reduce class (and racial) disparities in American public schools.

8906,what role does glut4 play in cancer cell survival?,A role for GLUT3 in glioblastoma cell invasion that is not recapitulated by GLUT1,"ABSTRACT The multifaceted roles of metabolism in invasion have been investigated across many cancers. The brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive and metabolically plastic tumor with an inevitable recurrence. The neuronal glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) was previously reported to correlate with poor glioma patient survival and be upregulated in GBM cells to promote therapeutic resistance and survival under restricted glucose conditions. It has been suggested that the increased glucose uptake mediated by GLUT3 elevation promotes survival of circulating tumor cells to facilitate metastasis. Here we suggest a more direct role for GLUT3 in promoting invasion that is not dependent upon changes in cell survival or metabolism. Analysis of glioma datasets demonstrated that GLUT3, but not GLUT1, expression was elevated in invasive disease. In human xenograft derived GBM cells, GLUT3, but not GLUT1, elevation significantly increased invasion in transwell assays, but not growth or migration. Further, there were no changes in glycolytic metabolism that correlated with invasive phenotypes. We identified the GLUT3 C-terminus as mediating invasion: substituting the C-terminus of GLUT1 for that of GLUT3 reduced invasion. RNA-seq analysis indicated changes in extracellular matrix organization in GLUT3 overexpressing cells, including upregulation of osteopontin. Together, our data suggest a role for GLUT3 in increasing tumor cell invasion that is not recapitulated by GLUT1, is separate from its role in metabolism and survival as a glucose transporter, and is likely broadly applicable since GLUT3 expression correlates with metastasis in many solid tumors.","GLUT3 promotes invasion in glioblastoma cells, separate from its role in metabolism and survival as a glucose transporter.",question,1674,122.0
10643,Does decriminalizing drugs increase usage?,"An Economic Analysis of Alcohol, Drugs, and Violent Crime in the National Crime Victimization Survey","The purpose of this paper is to examine the direct relationship between the prices of alcohol and drugs and the incidence of criminal violence in a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States. The positive association between substance use and violence is well documented, as is the negative relationship between the quantity of alcohol or drugs consumed and their prices. These two relationships together form the principal hypothesis examining whether increases in substance prices will directly decrease the incidence of criminal violence. Violence is measured by assault, rape/sexual assault and robbery. Measures of alcohol or drug involved violent crimes are also considered. The data come from the 1992, 1993 and 1994 National Crime Victimization Surveys. A reduced form model is estimated in which the probability of being a victim of a violent crime is determined by the full prices of alcohol and illegal drugs, the arrest rates for violent crimes, and characteristics of the respondent. Individual- level fixed effects are also employed in some models. Results from the preferred specifications indicate that higher beer taxes lead to a lower incidence of assault, but not rape or robbery. Higher beer taxes will also lead to lower probabilities of alcohol- or drug-involved assault. Decriminalizing marijuana will result in a higher incidence of assault and robbery, while higher cocaine prices will decrease these crimes.",Decriminalizing marijuana may result in a higher incidence of assault and robbery.,question,1459,82.0
15976,do women have larger airways then men?,Hormones could help explain lower rates of asthma in men,"Women are twice as likely as men to be afflicted by asthma, the airway constricting condition that can range from annoying to life-altering. Before puberty, however, the trend is reversed: Young boys are more likely to have asthma than girls. The reasons behind the sex-based switch remain “enigmatic,” says Darryl Zeldin, an asthma expert at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, but scientists suggest that the shift may be connected to changes in sex hormones. A new study, led by Dawn C. Newcomb at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, provides a potential molecular mechanism (Cell Rep. 2017, DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.110).

1694,effectiveness of influencer marketing on small business growth,Influencer Marketing Effectiveness,"Influencer marketing initiatives require firms to select and incentivize online influencers to engage their followers on social media in an attempt to promote the firms’ offerings. However, limited research considers the costs of influencer marketing when evaluating these campaigns’ effectiveness, particularly from an engagement elasticity perspective. Moreover, it is unclear whether and how marketers could enhance influencer marketing effectiveness by strategically selecting influencers, targeting their followers, or managing content. This study draws on a communication model to examine how factors related to the sender of a message (influencer), the receiver of the message (influencer's followers), and the message itself (influencer's posts) determine influencer marketing effectiveness. The findings show that influencer originality, follower size, and sponsor salience enhance effectiveness, and posts that announce new product launches diminish it. Several tensions arise when firms select influencers and manage content: Influencer activity, follower–brand fit, and post positivity all exert inverted U-shaped moderating effects on influencer marketing effectiveness, suggesting that firms that adopt a balanced approach along these dimensions can achieve greater effectiveness. These novel insights offer important implications for marketers designing influencer marketing campaigns.","Influencer originality, follower size, and sponsor salience enhance influencer marketing effectiveness.",phrase,1400,103.0
9855,is the human mind separate from the human body?,"Thinking with the Body: Towards Hierarchical, Scalable Cognition","Publisher Summary The reflection on the nature of mind has a long history. In western tradition, this reflection has mostly taken place along the so-called dualist approach, where mind and body completely have different characteristics and even natures. In this dualistic context for understanding thought (and life!), the biggest problem has always been how these two realms—the physical and the mental—could possibly interact: the mind–body problem is the unavoidable sequel to this dualist standpoint. The embodied cognition movement tries to reconcile this apparently multiple qualities (duality and unity) of human experience by means of analyzing the ways in which the body may affect cognition: supporting, sustaining, shaping, etc. Mind and body cannot be separated because cognitive agents think with the body. Mind, as a separate entity, is in the eye of the beholder. This chapter contends that the mind–body problem is not a problem of minds and bodies in the world—that is, a physical problem of interaction—but simply an artificial, conceptual problem for philosophers/scientists. The way to come out of the problem is to realize that minds and bodies are not separate entities, but what are separate are the mental concepts used in thinking about them; that is, what most thinkers use to think about minds and bodies as ontologically fully separate entities. However this way of thinking is misleading. Minds can be reduced to bodies because they are simply processes that run on them.","Cognitive agents think with the body, suggesting that minds and bodies are not separate entities, but rather interconnected processes.",question,1500,134.0
21355,does yoga help adhd,Yoga and the therapy of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the commonest psychiatric disorders in children. Stimulants are frequently used in the management of ADHD. Due to adverse effects of medication there is a growing interest in complementary treatments. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies including yoga are commonly used in children with ADHD, but little is known about the efficacy of these therapies. Yoga requires long periods of concentration and is therefore supposed to reduce attention deficits. The published investigations without a control group report positive effects of yoga on ADHD symptoms and school performance. However, these studies do not allow causal conclusions in regard to the effects of yoga in the treatment of ADHD. The findings from exploratory randomized controlled studies suggest that future research on the efficacy of yoga in ADHD may yield results of therapeutic value. At present the small number of available investigations renders impossible the drawing of any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of yoga for ADHD in children. Large, well-controlled, randomized trials are needed in order to establish the potential value of yoga as a single treatment or adjunct to standard ADHD therapies.","Yoga is commonly used in children with ADHD, but more large, well-controlled, randomized trials are needed to establish its effectiveness.",question,1251,138.0

The potential of this powerful tool has spurred a call for establishing robust regulatory frameworks to outline permissible uses of genome editing and to map a rational and ethical course. In response, major national scientific bodies and international organizations have convened and released comprehensive reports outlining recommendations for ethical regulatory frameworks. Significantly, these include an emphasis on public participation and the development of principles to guide future applications of genome editing. While essential, public input and principles are not sufficient to ensure ethical uses of this technology. We propose an approach that relies not only on agreed-upon principles and a democratic process but requires a Human Rights Impact Assessment to evaluate the potential burdens that such biomedical interventions may place on human rights.","An ethical approach to human germline genome editing should include public participation, agreed-upon principles, and a Human Rights Impact Assessment to evaluate potential burdens on human rights.",question,968,197.0
15173,what is the gravity gradient anomaly,Invariance in gravimagnetic anomaly formulas for uniform polyhedra,"The anomaly formulas of gravitation and magnetics for uniform polyhedral targets are related by the gradient operation. The relationship enforces an invariance among subexpressions of the formulas. Knowledge of the invariance is not new. However, its role as a simplifier in an abstract calculus of anomaly functions is novel. This is exemplified by the derivation of anomaly formula variants of practical value. The gravitational potential V of a uniform polyhedral target allows compact expression to terms of certain vector functions b ij , one associated with each edge j of every target facet i , as defined in Holstein (2002). The derivation requires integration of elementary volume and surface integrals associated with the Newtonian potential.

2273,are orgasms good for my health?,Disorders of orgasm in women.,"INTRODUCTION
Orgasm is a sensation of intense pleasure creating an altered consciousness state accompanied by pelvic striated circumvaginal musculature and uterine/anal contractions and myotonia that resolves sexually-induced vasocongestion and induces well-being/contentment. In 1,749 randomly-sampled U.S. women, 24% reported an orgasmic dysfunction.


AIM
To provide recommendations/guidelines concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for management of orgasmic disorders in women.


METHODS
An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a process over a 2-year period. Concerning the Disorders of Orgasm in Women Committee, there were four experts from two countries.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation and debate.


RESULTS
Female Orgasmic Disorder, the second most frequently reported women's sexual problem is considered to be the persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty (DSM-IV). Empirical treatment outcome research is available for cognitive behavioral and pharmacological approaches. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anorgasmia promotes attitude and sexually-relevant thought changes and anxiety reduction using behavioral exercises such as directed masturbation, sensate focus, and systematic desensitization treatments as well as sex education, communication skills training, and Kegel exercises. To date there are no pharmacological agents trials (i.e., bupropion, granisetron, and sildenafil) proven to be beneficial beyond placebo in enhancing orgasmic function in women diagnosed with Female Orgasmic Disorder.

1860,which inflammatory proteins are produced by gut bacteria,Innate and adaptive immunity interact to quench microbiome flagellar motility in the gut.,"Gut mucosal barrier breakdown and inflammation have been associated with high levels of flagellin, the principal bacterial flagellar protein. Although several gut commensals can produce flagella, flagellin levels are low in the healthy gut, suggesting the existence of control mechanisms. We find that mice lacking the flagellin receptor Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) exhibit a profound loss of flagellin-specific immunoglobulins (Igs) despite higher total Ig levels in the gut. Ribotyping of IgA-coated cecal microbiota showed Proteobacteria evading antibody coating in the TLR5(-/-) gut. A diversity of microbiome members overexpressed flagellar genes in the TLR5(-/-) host. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes penetrated small intestinal villi, and flagellated bacteria breached the colonic mucosal barrier. In vitro, flagellin-specific Ig inhibited bacterial motility and downregulated flagellar gene expression. Thus, innate-immunity-directed development of flagellin-specific adaptive immune responses can modulate the microbiome's production of flagella in a three-way interaction that helps to maintain mucosal barrier integrity and homeostasis.","Flagellin, the principal bacterial flagellar protein, is associated with gut mucosal barrier breakdown and inflammation.",question,1145,120.0

21103,do children with dsd have good quality of life,"Survival status, morbidity and health related quality of life in individuals with Down Syndrome in Pakistan: study protocol for a web-based collaborative registry (Preprint)","
 BACKGROUND
 Down Syndrome(DS) is the most common chromosomal disorder, with a global incidence of 1 in 700 live births. However, the true prevalence, associated morbidities and health related quality of life (HRQOL) of these individuals and their families is not well documented, especially in low-middle income countries(LMIC) like Pakistan. In order to better understand this condition and the associated health outcomes, a disease -specific documentation in the form of a collaborative registry is required. This protocol paper describes the aims and processes to develop the first comprehensive web-based collaborative registry for DS in a Pakistani cohort.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 To identify long term survival, morbidity and health-related quality of life in individuals patients with DS, using a web based collaborative registry.
 
 
 METHODS
 The registry data collection will be conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) and at the Karachi DS Program (KDSP). Data will be collected by in-person interview, and virtually via telephone call or video interview. Participants of any age and gender with DS (trisomy 21) will be recruited. After receiving informed consent and assent, a series of tablet-based questionnaires will be administered. The questionnaires aim to assess the socio-demographic background, clinical status and the HRQOL of the participants. Data will be collected and analyzed, with the mean and standard deviation of continuous variables and percentages for the categorical variables will be reported. A multivariate regression analysis will be conducted to identify predictors related to HRQOL in DS.
 
 
 RESULTS
 This registry is a proof-of-concept study, with results being published soon after commencement.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 This registry will allow a comprehensive understanding of DS in a LMIC. This can provide the opportunity for data-informed interventions in tailored to the specific needs of this patient population and their families. Though this web- based registry is a proof of concept, it has the potential to be expanded to the national, regional and international level.

IN 2009, THE National League for Nursing (NLN) conducted a survey to examine the challenges nurse educators faced when choosing and scheduling experiences for students' clinical learning (Ironside & McNelis, 2010). The results indicated the most frequently identified challenge faced by nurse educators was the lack of clinical sites to provide appropriate learning experiences to meet course objectives. Finding clinical sites for specialty nursing courses, such as pediatrics, can be the most difficult of all clinical placements (Kline & Hodges, 2006). This clinical site shortage provides nurse educators the opportunity to redesign classroom and clinical learning activities to meet the learning objectives for acute pediatric disorders. Technology use in nursing education is widely encouraged (Herman, 2011). Nursing education has adapted to include the use of simulation, gaming, virtual reality, and interactive case studies that can teach acute care in a safe learning environment. Additionally, the traditional student of nursing is one that adapts easily to learning activities utilizing technology (Pardue & Morgan, 2008).

A longitudinal test of the contact hypothesis among majority and minority groups in three European countries.,"A widely researched panacea for reducing intergroup prejudice is the contact hypothesis. However, few longitudinal studies can shed light on the direction of causal processes: from contact to prejudice reduction (contact effects) or from prejudice to contact reduction (prejudice effects). The authors conducted a longitudinal field survey in Germany, Belgium, and England with school students. The sample comprised members of both ethnic minorities (n = 512) and ethnic majorities (n = 1,143). Path analyses yielded both lagged contact effects and prejudice effects: Contact reduced prejudice, but prejudice also reduced contact. Furthermore, contact effects were negligible for minority members. These effects were obtained for 2 indicators of prejudice: negative intergroup emotions and desire for social distance. For both majority and minority members, contact effects on negative emotions were stronger when outgroup contacts were perceived as being typical of their group.

16785,why audiencies are avoiding the news?,Counting Time: Journalism and the Temporal Resource,"‘Time affects the work of every institution, but few so substantially as the news media.’ This statement by political scientist Thomas Patterson (1998: 56) underscores the significance of time for understanding journalism and its challenges (see also Barnhurst, 2011). Concurrently, it exposes the prevailing view about the direction of the relationship between time and journalism. In scholarly, journalistic and popular discourse, time is commonly viewed as a factor that influences, shapes and constrains journalistic practice. From this perspective, journalists increasingly struggle to meet the demands of accelerating news cycles (Boyer, 2010; Klinenberg, 2005), while having to produce more news in less time (Boczkowski, 2010) and compete with online actors who have temporal advantages over traditional journalism. This news culture of immediacy and speed is situated within the broader temporal conditions of contemporary society, including the accelerated compression of time in post/late modernity (Harvey, 1989; Virilio, 2000), or what Douglas Rushkoff (2013) calls ‘Present Shock.’ Time pressures are also seen as undermining the ability of journalists to fulfill their societal roles (Patterson, 1998; Plasser, 2005; Rosenberg and Feldman, 2008). According to this view, the focus on an ever-more fleeting present and the need to produce news that meets the demands of accelerating news cycles lead to the production of news stories that are shortsighted, shallow and inadequately verified, and that reflect sudden events rather than enduring problems.","Time pressures in journalism lead to the production of news stories that are shortsighted, shallow, and inadequately verified, reflecting sudden events rather than enduring problems.",question,1567,182.0
22736,what is small medium enterprise?,Micro Entrepreneurship: Sources of Finance & Related Constraints,"Abstract In India, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (micro SMEs) play an important role in the country's economic development. According to RBI, the definition of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is as follows: Enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services and whose investment in equipment (original cost excluding land and building and furniture, fittings and other items not directly related to the service rendered or as may be notified under the MSMED Act, 2006 are specified below. a) A micro enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment does not exceed Rs. 10 lakh; b) A small enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment is more than Rs.10 lakh but does not exceed Rs. 2 crore; and c) A medium enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment is more than Rs. 2 crore but does not exceed Rs. 5 crore. The research paper focuses on the point (a) of the above definition: The micro enterprises. Finance forms the most critical input for a business enterprise whether large or small. All firms require financing to grow and survive. Sources of finance may be external, such as loans, equity infusions, subsidies and government grants, or internal such as generated cash flows or owned funds. Many firms are self- financed in the beginning. Once the firms reach certain degree of maturity in the development of their product line and customer base, external finance becomes available. The flow of institutional finance is linked with the credit worthiness of the enterprise. Micro enterprises, due to their small size and low capital base, generally find it difficult to satisfy the conditions laid down by the banks, particularly, in establishing the viability of the project, meeting collateral requirements and making timely repayment of loans. Hence, they do not find a place among the preferred clients of the banks. In today's world, micro businesses and particularly new ones are seen more than ever as a vehicle for entrepreneurship, contributing not just to employment, social and political stability, but also to innovative and competitive power. The focus has shifted from small businesses as a social good that should be maintained at an economic cost, to small businesses as a vehicle for entrepreneurship. With this shift came the renewed perception of the important role of entrepreneurship. Indeed, recent econometric evidence suggests that entrepreneurship is a vital determinant of economic growth.",A small medium enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment is more than Rs.10 lakh but does not exceed Rs. 2 crore.,question,2498,133.0
11743,do children with neurological soft signs have altered brain structures?,"Diagnostic specificity and predictors of neurological soft signs in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses over the first 4 years of illness","BACKGROUND
Neurological soft signs (NSS) are well described among patients with schizophrenia, the neurology of other psychoses is relatively unexplored and few comparative studies have prospectively examined these signs in first-episode patients.


METHODS
We assessed neurological functioning in 242 patients presenting with a first episode of psychosis (in accordance with DSM-IV diagnosis) using the Condensed Neurological Examination (CNE). We sought to determine whether NSS were specific to patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other forms of psychosis. We also examined the factors associated with and predictive of neurodysfunction at first presentation and at 4 year follow-up.


RESULTS
NSS were not specific to any diagnostic group. Neurological functioning was closely associated with psychopathology and mixed-handedness at first presentation. At follow-up there was a statistically significant improvement in neurological functioning. Persistent neurodysfunction at this stage was related to enduring negative symptoms and associated with poorer outcome.


DISCUSSION
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are indistinguishable in terms of neurodysfunction at presentation. At presentation and 4 years NSS closely parallel psychopathology and mixed-handedness indicating that NSS may be a function of these factors or possibly an independent factor operates equally upon both symptoms and neurological function.",Neurological soft signs (NSS) are not specific to any diagnostic group and are closely associated with psychopathology and mixed-handedness at first presentation.,question,1446,162.0
18568,fluoride effects,Fluoride Fact on Human Health and Health Problems: A Review,"Fluorine (F-) is a chemically reactive electronegative univalent gaseous halogen found in small amount in the water, air, plants and animals. Fluorine is essential for the maintenance and solidification of our bones and to prevent dental decay. It has beneficial effects on teeth and bones when it is present at low concentration in drinking water, but excessive exposure to fluoride in drinking-water, or in combination with exposure to fluoride from other sources, can give rise to a number of adverse effects which include teeth decay, osteoporosis and harm to kidney, bones, reproductive organs, nerve and muscle. Fluoride, when in excess, is known to interfere with thyroid gland function causing TSH elevation and lessen T3/T4 hormones in some populations which may be due to its antagonistic properties towards iodine. As an endocrine disruptor, F- induces more toxic outcome in diabetic patients. Chronic F- exposure through drinking water may leads to insulin resistance in humans in addition to its hyperglycemic effect due to increased hepatic glycogenolysis. Fluoride also hinders glycolysis by inhibiting enolase enzyme and repressed insulin secretion from islets of Langerhans cells resulting in elevation of blood glucose level. 
High F- exposure is also associated with increased levels of FSH and LH, decreased estrogen and testosterone levels, disturbed androgen to estrogen ratios (A/E) and estrogen receptor to androgen receptor ratios (ER/AR). Decreased circulating testosterone concentrations were also reported in male skeletal fluorosis patients. The most significant consequences of fluoride exposures in male reproduction are: changes in the structure and functional activities of spermatozoa and disruption of spermatogenesis while in an experimental data involving female rats showed that high fluoride concentration lowers the pregnancy rate and the number of implantation. Most interestingly, recent research showed that exposure to high concentration of F- does have deleterious effect on the mental ability of children. A strong association between exposure to fluoride and low IQ was found and it was also noted that children who live in fluorosis prevalent areas have higher chances of developing a low IQ than those who live in normal areas. So it is clear that the severity of the above pathological conditions is dependent on the dose, duration and age of the individual. Therefore, to ensure whether people need any fluoride supplements or not, government should have to take initiative to prevent health problems due to deficiency or excess fluoride exposure. Evidence-wise further thorough research is essential based on scientific facts to enlighten best practices in the use of fluoride containing materials for the safety and security of public health.","Excessive exposure to fluoride can cause teeth decay, osteoporosis, harm to kidney, bones, reproductive organs, nerve and muscle, and negatively affect mental ability in children.",phrase,2795,179.0

3436,what is the impact of the mitochondrial dna in the pathogenecity in onygenales?,Precision modeling of mitochondrial diseases in zebrafish via DdCBE-mediated mtDNA base editing,"Dear Editor, Mitochondrial diseases are a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders that are characterized by dysfunctional mitochondria and often manifest as severe even lethal condition. Mitochondrial diseases can arise from mutations affecting either the nuclear gene or the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whereas pathogenic mutations in mtDNA more commonly cause mitochondrial disease than mutations in nuclear genes do. Up to now, more than 270 pathogenic variants of mtDNA have been reported. Animal models which precisely install these variants are urgently needed both to deepen our understanding for the etiology of mitochondrial diseases and to develop therapeutic strategies. The development of such models, however, has been hindered by the technical challenge of editing mtDNA in a programmable fashion. In recent years, some progresses have been made for mitochondrial genome engineering. Re-engineered RNA-free programmable nucleases such as mtZFN and mitoTALEN function effectively in mitochondria. In a recent work, researchers harnessed a bacterial cytidine deaminase, DddA, to archive precise manipulation of mtDNA sequences. In this system, the domain containing 1264–1427 amino acids of DddA (DddAtox) was split into two inactive halves, which were fused with transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor, resulting in DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs). Besides the study in tissue culture system, installation of disease-associated mtDNA variants in mouse with this DddAtox-TALE strategy has been reported lately. Acclaimed for multiple research advantages and flexibility of manipulation, zebrafish is an attractive animal model for studying human disease. The ability to generate pathogenic mtDNA mutations in zebrafish could accelerate the researches ranging from mitochondrial biology, drug discovery to therapeutic approaches development. In the current study, we set out to utilize the TALEDddAtox fusion deaminases to establish a method for generating models of zebrafish mitochondrial diseases. At first, a variable di-residue (RVD) plasmid library including 192 modules, as well as 4 MTS-DdCBE (mitochondrial localization) and 4 NLS-DdCBE (nuclear localization) backbone plasmids, were constructed (Supplementary Fig. S1a–c). With this library, DdCBE expression plasmids for any desired target site can be obtained within 36 h by one-step Golden Gate assembly (Fig. 1a). To verify the activity of DdCBE, we generated 4 pairs of MTS-DdCBE for the reported ND1 site (Supplementary Fig. S2a), including LeftG1333C (L1333C)+Right-G1333N (R1333N), L1333N+ R1333C, L1397C+R1397N and L1397N+R1397C. First, we examined the subcellular localization of the L1333C+ R1333N pair in HEK293FT cells and found that they could successfully locate to mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Then we transfected cells with each DdCBE pair and found that the ratio of C-to-T conversion increased over time (Supplementary Fig. S2c). To quantitatively evaluate the editing efficiency of DdCBE pairs, deep sequencing was performed. The results showed that different split types and orientations of DddAtox could mediate variable editing efficiencies, with the highest efficiency up to 80.12 ± 3.76% (Supplementary Fig. S2d). These results demonstrate that DdCBE pairs generated by our RVD library can facilitate efficient mtDNA editing in human cell.

9156,does vitamin c affect humoral immune response,Vitamin C-treated murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells preferentially drive naïve T cells into Th1 cells by increased IL-12 secretions.,"Vitamin C has been reported to shift immune responses toward Th1. In this study, we evaluated whether this effect was by way of dendritic cells. Murine dendritic cells (DCs) were prepared from bone marrow precursors. DCs treated with vitamin C secreted an increased amount of IL-12p70 after activation with LPS. These cells rendered naïve T cells to secrete more Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, and less Th2-cytokine, IL-5 in the culture supernatants. Vitamin C-treatment also increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 in DCs. p38 inhibitor in culture media suppressed the effect of vitamin C to elevate IL-12p70 secretion. In contrast, ERK inhibitor elevated IL-12p70 secretion. In summary, vitamin C taken up into DCs increased IL-12p70 secretion of these cells by modulating the activation of signal molecules, and thus shifted immune responses toward Th1. These data provide us a new insight on the role of vitamin C in modulating immune responses.","Vitamin C-treated dendritic cells increase IL-12 secretion, shifting immune responses toward Th1.",question,943,97.0
11513,Do you need to hit failure to stimulate muscle hypertrophy?,The biochemical response of the heart to hypertension and exercise.,"Mechanical stress on the heart can lead to crucially different outcomes. Exercise is beneficial because it causes heart muscle cells to enlarge (hypertrophy). Chronic hypertension also causes hypertrophy, but in addition it causes an excessive increase in fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (fibrosis), death of cardiomyocytes and ultimately heart failure. Recent research shows that stimulation of physiological (beneficial) hypertrophy involves several signaling pathways, including those mediated by protein kinase B (also known as Akt) and the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Hypertension, beta-adrenergic stimulation and agonists such as angiotensin II (Ang II) activate not only ERK1/2 but also p38 and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to pathological heart remodeling. Despite this progress, the mechanisms that activate fibroblasts to cause fibrosis and those that differentiate between exercise and hypertension to produce physiological and pathological responses, respectively, remain to be established.","Exercise causes heart muscle cells to enlarge (hypertrophy) and is beneficial, while chronic hypertension leads to fibrosis and heart failure.",question,1048,142.0

It is usually treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular-targeted therapy. Immunotherapy is a novel treatment modality for esophageal cancer wherein genetically engineered adoptive cell therapy is utilized, which modifies immune cells to attack cancer cells. Using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T cell receptor (TCR) modified T cells yielded demonstrably encouraging efficacy in patients. CAR-T cell therapy has shown robust clinical results for malignant hematological diseases, particularly in B cell-derived malignancies. Natural killer (NK) cells could serve as another reliable and safe CAR engineering platform, and CAR-NK cell therapy could be a more generalized approach for cancer immunotherapy because NK cells are histocompatibility-independent.

Green roofs have good heat preservation and insulation performance, which plays an important role in reducing air-conditioning load and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Experimental research and numerical simulation analysis on the energy-savings and ecological benefits of green roofs in hot summer and cold winter areas in Wuxi, China (31°N, 120°E) are carried out. The experimental results show that a new type of Buddha grass can absorb 1.79 kg of CO2 and release 1.3 kg of O2 per square meter per year. In addition, the annual carbon emission reduction of the green roof in Wuxi was 9.35 kg m–2, and the emission reduction benefit of the green roof was calculated to be USD $1.02 m–2 a–1. The energy consumption simulation shows that the green roof per unit area can save 11.53 kWh per year, and the annual quantitative ecological benefit of a green roof is USD $3.37 m–2. The calculated dynamic investment return is 10 years. A green roof has the benefits of heat preservation and insulation; meanwhile, it can reduce energy consumption.

7111,what effect does orientalism have in movies?,"Orientalism, terrorism and Bombay cinema","This paper critically assesses the usefulness of the “new-Orientalism” thesis in understanding the discourses around the idea of “terrorism” and of “the terrorist”. It observes that critiques of “new Orientalism” provide important insights into the ways in which “Islam”, “the Muslim” and “terrorist” have come to be constructed. However, it also argues for the importance of the density of historical context and specificity of locality in understanding how these categories are formulated. The case of Bombay cinema is particularly instructive here. The paper argues that Bombay cinema – which has engaged with these concerns in some form since its inception, and is going “global” in unprecedented ways – exemplifies both the play of these two distinct discursive tendencies and also the tensions that arise because they are not identical. Post-9/11 films like Aamir (2008) and New York (2009) manifest these discursive mechanics and the tensions that result from the play between “new Orientalism” and the local.","Bombay cinema exemplifies the play of ""new Orientalism"" and its influence on the construction of ""Islam,"" ""the Muslim,"" and ""terrorist"" in movies.",question,1016,146.0

Eighty-four percent of the subjects reported experiencing at least one event of sufficient intensity potentially to elicit Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One-third of the sample had experienced four or more traumatic events. Subjects who had experienced trauma reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology than nontraumatized subjects, and these symptoms were more intense in subjects who experienced multiple traumas. Events that were particularly negative in their impact included unwanted sexual experiences and events that subjects reported were too traumatic to discuss openly.

8832,does gender diversity increase workplace productivity?,Diversity and Social Capital Within the Workplace: Evidence from Britain,"This paper uses the British Workplace Employee Relations Survey to investigate the impact of gender and ethnic diversity on workers' level of trust in managers and the extent of identity with the values and objectives of the firm - dimensions of what we might call social capital within the workplace. These are both factors that one might expect to make firms more co-operative and, hence, productive. In contrast to much of the existing literature we pay particular attention to the estimation of causal effects, using an instrumental variable strategy. We find evidence that both women and minorities have higher levels of workplace trust and identity as individuals. But we also find evidence that a higher female share in the plant is associated with higher trust and identity (stronger for trust than identity) and that a higher minority share is associated lower trust and identity (stronger for identity than trust). However, in line with much of the literature, these results are not always significantly different from zero and they are sensitive to specification.","A higher female share in the workplace is associated with higher trust and identity, which may make firms more co-operative and productive.",question,1074,139.0

Method: A retrospective cohort study of all patients suffering from pulmonary and extra pulmonary TB patients, patients co-infected with HIV, hepatitis, and diabetes mellitus were included for current study that were treated at Khyber teaching hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. On the basis of our study objective patients were categorised on gender basis and association with their demographics and clinical characteristics was observed. Treatment outcomes were evaluated on basis of smear testing at the end of treatment and the results were compared with TB patients’ gender Result: A total of 472 TB patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which included 238 (50.4%) male and 234 (49.6%) female patients. Two hundred and twenty eight (48.3%) male patients and 230 (48.7%) female patients were new TB cases whereas 224 (47.4%) male and 216 (45.6%) female patient TB type was pulmonary. TB patient age group, employment status and smoking status had a statistical significant association with gender (p 0.002, p 0.02, p < 0.001 respectively). The strongest predictor that affected TB patient gender was age group >55 years (OR 0.45, p 0.001).

9080,effect of ses on gender roles,"Gender Differences in Self-Estimated Intelligence: Exploring the Male Hubris, Female Humility Problem","Despite evidence from cognitive psychology that men and women are equal in measured intelligence, gender differences in self-estimated intelligence (SEI) are widely reported with males providing systematically higher estimates than females. This has been termed the male hubris, female humility effect. The present study explored personality factors that might explain this. Participants (N = 228; 103 male, 125 female) provided self-estimates of their general IQ and for Gardner’s multiple intelligences, before completing the Cattell Culture Fair IQ test as an objective measure of intelligence. They also completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) as a measure of sex-role identification, and measures of general and academic self-esteem. Both gender and sex-role differences were observed for SEI, with males and participants of both genders who scored high in masculinity offering higher self-estimates. By comparing estimated and observed IQ, we were able to rule out gender differences in overall accuracy but observed a pattern of systematic underestimation in females. An hierarchical multiple regression showed significant independent effects of gender, masculinity, and self-esteem. Mixed evidence was observed for gender differences in the estimation of multiple intelligences, though moderately sized sex-role differences were observed. The results offer a far more nuanced explanation for the male hubris, female humility effect that includes the contribution of sex role identification to individual and group differences.","Males and individuals with high masculinity scores tend to have higher self-estimated intelligence, contributing to the male hubris, female humility effect.",phrase,1538,156.0

Results: Twelve percent of women who reported a dating partner in the past year were physically or sexually assaulted, 12.1% were stalked, and 9.1% scored as psychologically abused. Among those experiencing partner violence, almost half experienced stalking and 89% reported psychological abuse. Few women (25%) who experienced physical violence believed violence was a problem in their relationship. Conclusions: Partner violence was prevalent in this population, and participants experienced many forms of violence. Because few women experiencing physical violence report that violence is a problem in their relationship, interventions must address perceptions of violence and its impact on women's mental and physical health in college populations.","12% of Mexican American college women aged 18 to 35 years experienced physical or sexual assault, 12.1% were stalked, and 9.1% faced psychological abuse in their relationships.",question,933,176.0
13191,what you see versus what you notice,Detecting changes in naturalistic scenes: contextual inconsistency does not influence spontaneous attention in high‐functioning people with autism spectrum disorder,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often reported to be good at detecting minute changes in the environment. This study tested two factors in this phenomenon; detail‐focus and reduced top‐down influence of scene‐schema expectations on spontaneous attention to visual scene elements. Using a change blindness paradigm, adults with ASD and matched typically developing (TD) adults were presented with images of naturalistic scenes (e.g., living room). Scene changes involved three types of object substitution: an object was replaced with (i) an unexpected scene‐unrelated object, (ii) a scene‐related object of a different basic‐level category, (iii) or a different exemplar of the original object category. Top‐down effects of scene‐schema expectations should render scene‐unrelated (i) substitutions easiest to recognize; detail focus should increase detection of exemplar changes. The TD group showed the expected condition effects, detecting scene‐unrelated substitutions significantly better than both types of scene‐related changes. By contrast, the ASD group showed no condition effect, and was only significantly slower and less accurate than the TD group in detecting scene‐unrelated objects. These findings suggest reduced influence of schematic expectations on spontaneous attention in individuals with ASD. Together with other factors, this may contribute to the tendency to notice “irrelevant” changes in the environment.","Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show reduced influence of schematic expectations on spontaneous attention, which may contribute to their tendency to notice ""irrelevant"" changes in the environment.",question,1451,212.0

We hypothesized that ingestion of a single bolus of dietary NO3(-) ingestion improves oral glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes. Seventeen men with type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin, 7.3% ± 0.2%) participated in a randomized crossover experiment. The subjects ingested a glucose beverage 2.5 hours after consumption of either sodium NO3(-) (0.15 mmol NaNO3(-) · kg(-1)) or a placebo solution. Venous blood samples were collected before ingestion of the glucose beverage and every 30 minutes thereafter during a 2-hour period to assess postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The results show that plasma NO3(-) and nitrite levels were increased after NaNO3(-) as opposed to placebo ingestion (treatment-effect, P = .001). Despite the elevated plasma NO3(-) and nitrite levels, ingestion of NaNO3(-) did not attenuate the postprandial rise in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations (time × treatment interaction, P = .41 for glucose, P = .93 for insulin). Despite the lack of effect on oral glucose tolerance, basal plasma glucose concentrations measured 2.5 hours after NaNO3(-) ingestion were lower when compared with the placebo treatment (7.5 ± 0.4 vs 8.3 ± 0.4 mmol/L, respectively; P = .04).

Adolescents completed the Political Life Events (PLE) scale, Brief Symptom Inventory and questionnaires regarding parenting style and parental warmth. The primary caregiver completed the Child Behavior Checklist for assessment of the child’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results confirmed that severity of PLE exposure was positively correlated with psychological distress and with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Maternal authoritativeness and warmth functioned as protective factors and had moderating effects on the relation between PLE exposure and mental health symptoms. In contrast, maternal authoritarianism exacerbated the relation between PLE exposure and children’s externalizing symptoms. Fathers’ parenting style and warmth had no significant relationship with children’s mental health outcomes.

14562,is trophy hunting beneficial to maintain and protect wildlife ?,Cat Dilemma: Too Protected To Escape Trophy Hunting?,"Trophy hunting is one of the most controversial issues in the field of biodiversity conservation. In particular, proponents and opponents debate fiercely over whether it poses a threat to hunted populations. Here, we show that trophy hunting constitutes a greater menace to threatened species than previously realized. Because humans value rarity, targeted species that are threatened are likely to be disproportionately hunted, thereby becoming even more vulnerable, which could eventually push them to extinction. With the ten felid species currently hunted for their trophies, we present evidence that (1) the number of killed individuals increases with time, in several cases exponentially, despite population declines, (2) the price of trophies is strongly dependent on species protection status, (3) changes of protection status coincide with counter-intuitive changes of hunting pressures: protection intensification with augmented hunting effort, and protection relaxation with lower effort. This suggests an over-exploitation of trophy-hunted felids and the necessity of a better quota system coupled with reconsidered protection methods.","Trophy hunting poses a greater threat to threatened species than previously realized, potentially pushing them to extinction.",question,1147,125.0
17274,is modern number sense learned or innate?,An emergentist perspective on the origin of number sense,"The finding that human infants and many other animal species are sensitive to numerical quantity has been widely interpreted as evidence for evolved, biologically determined numerical capacities across unrelated species, thereby supporting a ‘nativist’ stance on the origin of number sense. Here, we tackle this issue within the ‘emergentist’ perspective provided by artificial neural network models, and we build on computer simulations to discuss two different approaches to think about the innateness of number sense. The first, illustrated by artificial life simulations, shows that numerical abilities can be supported by domain-specific representations emerging from evolutionary pressure. The second assumes that numerical representations need not be genetically pre-determined but can emerge from the interplay between innate architectural constraints and domain-general learning mechanisms, instantiated in deep learning simulations. We show that deep neural networks endowed with basic visuospatial processing exhibit a remarkable performance in numerosity discrimination before any experience-dependent learning, whereas unsupervised sensory experience with visual sets leads to subsequent improvement of number acuity and reduces the influence of continuous visual cues. The emergent neuronal code for numbers in the model includes both numerosity-sensitive (summation coding) and numerosity-selective response profiles, closely mirroring those found in monkey intraparietal neurons. We conclude that a form of innatism based on architectural and learning biases is a fruitful approach to understanding the origin and development of number sense.

9299,how does spacecraft guidance differ depending on the mission ?,Navigation Guidance and Control System,"The navigation, guidance and control (NGC) system, the brain of the vehicle, is responsible for directing the propulsive forces and stabilizing the vehicle along the desired path to achieve the orbit with the specified accuracy. The NGC system has to define the optimum trajectory in real time to reach the specified target and steer the vehicle along the desired path and inject the spacecraft into the mission targeted orbit within the specified dispersions. The navigation system measures the instantaneous state of the vehicle, and using this information, the guidance system generates the optimum trajectory to achieve the target and desired vehicle steering command to realize the optimum trajectory in real time. The vehicle control system, comprising of autopilot and control power plants, receives the steering commands from the guidance system and steers the vehicle to follow the desired attitude in the presence of all disturbances. The guidance system charts out the remaining path continuously, recalculating the desired attitude of the vehicle to achieve the mission target. Final mission objectives and allowable orbital dispersions dictate the choice of a suitable guidance system. The vehicle autopilot has three major functions namely, to ensure that the vehicle loads are always well within the specified limits, to stabilize the vehicle all through the flight and to steer the vehicle to follow the desired attitude as decided by the guidance system. The autopilot generates the control commands as per the defined control law which is used to drive the actuation systems to generate the necessary control forces. Proper choice of inertial sensors, inertial systems, guidance schemes, control actuation systems and control laws depend on the mission objectives and requirements. This chapter starts with the functional requirements and systems requirements of NGC system of a launch vehicle. The need for the integrated design of NGC system using systems engineering approach is explained next.

2691,what causes obesity?,"Intermediary Metabolism of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat","The causes of obesity in an individual may involve many factors, both genetic and environmental, including fat cell production and development, appetite and energy regulation. However, the excessive accumulation of triglyceride (triacylglycerol) that characterizes obesity and its effects on the use and storage of various fuels (glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids) are clearly the result of abnormalities in metabolism. The pathways of carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism and their interactions and regulatory mechanisms are described, including effects of insulin and counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and epinephrine. Fructose, incorporated increasingly in the diet, has relatively unregulated metabolism compared with glucose and may thus promote obesity. New insights that have been obtained from studies of genetic models with oblation or modification of particular enzymes or hormone receptors often in a tissue-specific manner are presented, in particular the insulin receptor and the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter Glut4 of muscle and fat cells. The enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is probably of central importance, as it has recently been identified as a cellular mediator of many events in intermediary metabolism and whose dysregulation may be a cause of disorders associated with the metabolic syndrome and a target for their therapy.","Excessive accumulation of triglyceride and abnormalities in metabolism, including the effects of insulin and hormones like glucagon and epinephrine, contribute to obesity.",question,1386,171.0

Abstract The incidence of sport-related concussion coupled with a doubling of the participation rate in youth hockey over the past two decades provides impetus for the review of the most promising concussion treatment options. This narrative review summarizes the future treatment options for sport-related concussions in ice hockey, while acknowledging their generalizability to concussion in all sports. Symptom assessment, sign observation, as well as cognitive and balance testing, have historically been used to diagnose a concussion. These methods continue to improve, but the need for effective treatments is clear. Pharmacologic, transcranial light, and nutritional supplement treatment options for concussion warranting further investigation have been identified. Dimethyl fumarate is an immunomodulatory compound thought to trigger antioxidant gene expression. Memantine reduces apoptosis and astrogliosis by inhibiting the calcium influx into cells normally caused by glutamate's activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Thioredoxin-mimetic peptides and transcranial photobiomodulation temper the effects of the energy crisis by acting as free radical scavengers. In addition, seven neuroprotective nutritional supplements have been identified: berberine, creatine, curcumin, melatonin, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, and vitamins. An estimated US $1.1 billion has been spent on unsuccessful traumatic brain injury clinical trials. As our ability to accurately diagnose concussion improves, dimethyl fumarate, memantine, thioredoxin-mimetic peptides, transcranial photobiomodulation, and nutritional supplements (berberine, creatine, curcumin, melatonin, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, and vitamins) warrant further preclinical and clinical examination in advancing the treatment of sport-related concussions.",Creatine is identified as one of the seven neuroprotective nutritional supplements warranting further investigation for concussion treatment.,question,2005,141.0

20244,does tramadol improve ocd?,Tramadol: Effects on sexual behavior in male rats are mainly caused by its 5-HT reuptake blocking effects,"&NA; Tramadol is a well‐known and effective analgesic. Recently it was shown that tramadol is also effective in human premature ejaculation. The inhibitory effect of tramadol on the ejaculation latency is probably due to its mechanism of action as a &mgr;‐opioid receptor agonist and noradrenaline/serotonin (5‐HT) reuptake inhibitor. In order to test this speculation, we tested several doses of tramadol in a rat model of male sexual behavior and investigated two types of drugs interfering with the &mgr;‐opioid and the 5‐HT system. First the &mgr;‐opioid receptor agonist properties of tramadol were tested with naloxone, a &mgr;‐opioid receptor antagonist. Second, the effects of WAY100,635, a 5‐HT1A receptor antagonist, were tested on the behavioral effects of tramadol. Finally the effects of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, combined with naloxone or WAY100,635 treatment, were compared to the effects of tramadol combined with these drugs. Results showed that naloxone, at a sexually inactive dose, could only partially antagonize the inhibitory effect of tramadol. Moreover, low and behaviorally inactive doses of WAY100,635, strongly decreased sexual behavior when combined with a behaviorally inactive dose of tramadol. Finally we showed that the effects of paroxetine on sexual behavior resembled the effects of tramadol, indicating that tramadol's inhibitory effects on sexual behavior are primarily and mainly caused by its SSRI properties and that its &mgr;‐opioid receptor agonistic activity only contributes marginally. These findings support the hypothesis that tramadol exerts inhibition of premature ejaculations in men by its 5‐HT reuptake inhibiting properties.

2388,does turkesterone really work for bodybuilding?,Synthesis and biological activities of turkesterone 11α-acyl derivatives,"Abstract Turkesterone is a phytoecdysteroid possessing an 11α-hydroxyl group. It is an analogue of the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. Previous ecdysteroid QSAR and molecular modelling studies predicted that the cavity of the ligand binding domain of the ecdysteroid receptor would possess space in the vicinity of C-11/C-12 of the ecdysteroid. We report the regioselective synthesis of a series of turkesterone 11α-acyl derivatives in order to explore this possibility. The structures of the analogues have been unambiguously determined by spectroscopic means (NMR and low-resolution mass spectrometry). Purity was verified by HPLC. Biological activities have been determined in Drosophila melanogaster BII cell-based bioassay for ecdysteroid agonists and in an in vitro radioligand-displacement assay using bacterially-expressed D. melanogaster EcR/USP receptor proteins. The 11α-acyl derivatives do retain a significant amount of biological activity relative to the parent ecdysteroid. Further, although activity initially drops with the extension of the acyl chain length (C2 to C4), it then increases (C6 to C10), before decreasing again (C14 and C20). The implications of these findings for the interaction of ecdysteroids with the ecdysteroid receptor and potential applications in the generation of affinity-labelled and fluorescently-tagged ecdysteroids are discussed.","Turkesterone 11α-acyl derivatives retain significant biological activity, suggesting potential applications in bodybuilding.",question,1388,124.0
2472,what is the best way to improve pull ups,Effects of Muscle Activation according to Grip Thickness in Pull-up,"PURPOSE: There are various variables such as exercise posture, exercise intensity, number of repetitions, and rest time of training for muscle strength development, and these variables are intended to stimulate muscle activity. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of muscle activation according to grip thickness in pull-up exercise. METHODS: Eleven healthy men were randomly crossover design assigned to pull-up exercise (concentric: 1-s, eccentric: 1-s, 2-s/repetition) to failure. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the forearm flexors/extensors, biceps brachii, trapezius middle/ lower and latissimus dorsi for muscle activation. Using the resulting EMG data, which were filtered of electromyogram artifacts, we calculated the root mean squares (RMS). RESULTS: Dependent-sample t-test produced a result, muscle activity in forearm flexors (p<.01), biceps brachii (p<.01), trapezius middle (p<.01), trapezius lower (p<.01) and latissimus dorsi (p<.05) were significantly increased at thick grip compared to normal grip in pull-up exercise. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the thicker the grip, the higher the muscle activation. Using a grip thickness as one of the variables for training programs is considered as a method to stimulate muscle activity.","Using a thicker grip in pull-up exercises leads to higher muscle activation, which may improve pull-up performance.",question,1293,115.0
1399,does sexual satisfaction in women have an impact on their self esteem?,The Relationship Between Self-esteem and Sexual Dysfunction in Women at Reproductive Ages: A Cross-sectional Study,"

Sexual dysfunction mainly results from psychological and personal causes.
These causes, including self-esteem, have been considered to be the dominant reason for sexual
dysfunction. Self-esteem is, in fact, among the basic factors in desirable personality development.



Investigation of the relationship between self-esteem and sexual dysfunction in women
at reproductive ages referred to healthcare centers in Shiraz, Iran.



 This epidemiological, analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted on
268 women at reproductive ages referred to healthcare centers in Shiraz in 2014-2015. The study
data were collected using a demographic information form, Female Sexual Function Index, and
Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale.



The results revealed a significant relationship between self-esteem and sexual function
(p=0.001), sexual desire (p=0.03), sexual arousal (p=0.01), and lubrication (p=0.026). However, no
significant correlation was observed among self-esteem and orgasm (p=0.54), sexual satisfaction
(p=0.3), and pain during intercourse (p=0.1). Investigation of the relationship between demographic
indicators and self-esteem showed that the spouse's education level had a significant statistical relationship
(p = 0.008) with self-esteem, while there was no significant relationship between self-esteem
and women's education level, husband's job, income, Body Mass Index (BMI), and age of women.



The results indicated that self-esteem was associated with sexual dysfunction. Accordingly,
individuals with lower self-esteem showed higher sexual dysfunction.

1518,red meat consumption increase the risk of heart disease?,Red Meat Consumption and the Risk of Stroke: A Dose-Response Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND
Prospective studies of red meat consumption and risk of stroke have provided inconsistent results. We aimed to assess this association by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.


METHODS
Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE through April 1, 2013. Summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by random-effect or fixed-effect models.


RESULTS
Seven prospective cohort studies were included in the analyses, involving 2,079,236 subjects and 21,730 strokes cases. Total red meat consumption was associated with total stroke (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24), cerebral infarction (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.0-1.28), and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.46). A significant association was found between consumption of processed red meat and total stroke (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.27). Consumption of fresh red meat was significantly associated with total stroke (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22) and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.29). However, no evidence suggests that any type of meat was associated with hemorrhagic stroke. Also, no association was found between consumption of processed red meat and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.15, 95% CI .98-1.36) and between consumption of fresh red meat and cerebral infarction (RR = 1.06, 95% CI [.94, 1.20]). A significant risk for total stroke could be observed when the consumption of total red meat was above 50 g/day, processed red meat was just above 0 g/day, and fresh red meat was above 70 g/day.


CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate that high consumption of red meat, especially processed red meat, will increase the risk of stroke.","High consumption of red meat, especially processed red meat, increases the risk of stroke.",phrase,1688,90.0
16803,Does artificial sweetener damage your gut?,Artificial sweetener consumption differentially affects the gut microbiota‐host metabolic interactions,"While there is general agreement on the safety and potential uses of artificial sweeteners, the literature is still lacking a consensus on their long‐term effects on gut microbiota and host‐microbe interactions. To this end, we examined the impact of chronic sweetener consumption on the gut microbiome in lean and diet‐induced obese rats. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (n=40) were randomized into two dietary groups; chow (CH, 12% kcal fat) and high fat (HF, 60% kcal fat). Each dietary group was further divided into groups consuming water or artificially sweetened water (0.4g/100mL EQUAL®, aspartame) for 8wk (n=10/treatment). Animals consumed food and fluids ad libitum. CH and HF animals showed a difference in weight gain and body fat, with the HF rats becoming obese and glucose intolerant (OGTT). Analysis of insulin tolerance (ITT) demonstrated sweetener consumption to reduce insulin sensitivity in both CH and HF. Analysis of the gut microbiome showed marked differences between both diet and fluid treatment. Total Eubacteria was reduced by HF, but maintained with sweetener consumption. Reductions in Lactobacillus were observed in CH sweetener and both HF groups. Bacteroides was reduced in both HF groups but not CH sweetener compared to water controls. In conclusion, results show sweetener to alter host‐microbe interactions in both chow and diet‐induced obese animals.","Artificial sweetener consumption alters gut microbiome-host interactions in both lean and obese rats, potentially affecting insulin sensitivity.",question,1382,144.0
15056,is cbt is widely recognized as an effective treatment for mental health conditions,The role of executive functioning in CBT: a pilot study with anxious older adults.,"Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for late life anxiety and depression. The successful use of CBT is assumed to rely on cognitive skills known as executive functions (EF; e.g., hypothesis generation, allocation of attention, self-monitoring) governed by the prefrontal cortex. Because older adults sometimes have executive deficits as a consequence of normal aging, EF may be a mediator of CBT outcome in older samples. The current pilot study tested the hypothesis that older adults with executive deficits (as measured by neuropsychological tests) would show decreased therapeutic benefit from CBT for generalized anxiety disorder, as compared to a group with intact EF. Results indicated differential response to CBT within the dysfunction group depending on the stability (and possibly, the etiology) of executive deficits from pre- to posttreatment. Those whose EF scores remained low from pre- to posttreatment did not respond to CBT, while those whose scores improved responded quite well, similar to an Intact EF group. Results indicate that some, but not all, older adults with executive dysfunction show decreased benefit from CBT, and are consistent with the assumption that executive skills are important for the successful use of CBT. However, some participants may show improvement on both mood and cognitive skills during treatment, which is discussed further.","CBT is an effective treatment for late life anxiety and depression, but some older adults with executive dysfunction may show decreased benefit from it.",question,1400,152.0
1466,does cognitive fatigue lead to accidents in the workplace?,Cognitive event-related potential waveform latency determination: Based on result of matching pursuit algorithm and Hilbert-Huang transform,"According to the statistics of car accident causes [11] given by Police of the Czech Republic, about 17.5 % of all car accidents are caused by lack of dedication to driving, including microsleep. A lot of car factories develop systems for fatigue prediction and microsleep detection. These systems are usually based on eye movement tracking or steering wheel movement analysis. But both these methods detect consequences of fatigue. From road safety point of view, it would be useful to be able to detect fatigue itself before it affects dedication to driving. We know there could be a correlation between cognitive event-related potential (ERP) waveform latency and the rate of attention - the longest the latency is, the more tired the measured subject is.

17562,is coffee harmful for our health?,Misclassification of exposure: coffee as a surrogate for caffeine intake.,"This study was conducted to assess the effect of exposure misclassification when coffee is used as a surrogate measure of caffeine exposure. Subjects were randomly selected from the telephone directories of four regional municipalities in southern Ontario, CANADA: Data on daily caffeine intake from foods, beverages, and medications were collected from June to November 1995 through self-administered, mailed questionnaires from 481 men and women aged 30-75 years. Although coffee was the main source of caffeine, cross-tabulations of exposure to coffee by total caffeine intake showed that assessment of coffee alone severely underestimated caffeine intake by at least one exposure level. A hypothetical 10-fold increase in risk was completely obscured when only coffee was used to estimate total caffeine intake. The results of this study suggest that measuring coffee instead of caffeine intake may contribute to a lack of positive findings in studies of coffee as a risk factor for disease occurrence, if in fact caffeine is the exposure of interest. On the other hand, measurement of coffee, tea, and cola soft drink intake in the present study appeared to approximate caffeine intake sufficiently and not affect risk estimates adversely.",Measuring coffee instead of caffeine intake may contribute to a lack of positive findings in studies of coffee as a risk factor for disease occurrence.,question,1244,151.0

Quantitative method and descriptive survey design were used in this study. Simple random sampling technique was adopted to select 200 students to participate in the study. Questionnaires were used to elicit data from respondents. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS. The following were major findings: the study revealed that the majority of students used WhatsApp and Facebook for making friends and chatting. Majority of the students indicated that social media sites affected their academic performance negatively because they were distracted from their studies. Also, students shared ideas, discussed and shared examination questions among themselves on social media sites. The researcher recommends creation of awareness on applications that are academic oriented so that the students can utilize them whenever they are online such as google drive, drop box, iBook among others. was homogenous thereby restricting their research findings. Furthermore, Paul, Baker and Cochran (2012) suggested that a negative relationship exists between time spent by students on social networking sites and their academic performance. A research by Asdaque, Khan and Rizvi (2010) was conducted on 100 undergraduate students of two federal universities in Pakistan. The research focused on the use of internet and its effects on academic performance. The results suggested a negative relationship. According to Akhtar (2013), excessive usage of internet can become an addiction especially among students and it can cause academic problems. The author suggested that internet addiction can cause a fall in time spent on studies, major drop in grades, low interest in extracurricular activities and lack of interest in classes. Jocabsen and Forste (2011) found a negative relationship between the use of various media, including mobile phones, and self-reported GPA among first year university students in the United States. Conversely, according to Pasek, More and Hargittai (2009), the use of Facebook has a positive relationship with academic performance. According to their research, the students with higher grades tend to spend more of their time on Facebook. Yunus, Nordin, Salehi, Embiand Salehi (2012) indicate that students gained more vocabulary and improve their writing skills as a result of their participation on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Again, other studies like Ahmed and Qazi (2011), Hanqittai and Hsich (2010), Pasek and Hanqittai (2009), conducted on the same topic exposed no correlation between social media and students’ academic performance. Negussie and Ketema (2014) study in Ethiopia also indicated that there is no significant relationship between times spent on social networks such as Facebook with students’ grade point average (GPA).

Results show that prejudice is substantially correlated with the respondents' reports of their own discriminatory intentions (R= .33 to .49). Controlling for additional psychological variables, the cross-lagged, longitudinal analyses support the causal hypothesis that prejudice leads to discriminatory intentions. Additional influences on discriminatory intentions—intergroup threat and intergroup contact—are substantially mediated by ethnic prejudice.

We controlled for both non-linear effects and heterogeneity by using a Pooled Mean Group estimator. There is robust evidence that the relationship is non-linear and we document a U-shaped effect of FDI on inequality. The results reveal that FDI increases equality of distribution of income in the countries examined. However, this effect diminishes with further increases in FDI. Policy implications emanating from this study suggest that although FDI may be growth enhancing, FDI-induced growth may not necessarily translate into a reduction in inequality. FDI has to be structured in such way that the resulting skill-biased employed is mitigated. To address inequality, policy implications from this study imply that FDI has to target both ends of the labour market.","FDI increases income equality in African countries initially, but this effect diminishes with further increases in FDI, suggesting a U-shaped relationship.",question,916,155.0

17427,why is fusion energy so hard?,Fusion burn equilibria sensitive to the ratio between energy and helium transport,"An analysis of the burn equilibria of fusion reactors of the tokamak family is presented. The global (zero-dimensional) analysis is self-consistent in that it takes into account the dependence of the energy confinement on the variables of the burning plasma, such as temperature and density. Universal burn contours are presented for a selection of commonly used scaling laws for energy confinement. It is shown that the output power of a fusion reactor is to good approximation inversely proportional to the particle confinement time, due to the choking effect of the accumulation of helium, the ash of the fusion reaction. It is further shown that, whereas a fusion reactor requires a minimum energy confinement time to ignite, the output power reaches a maximum for an energy confinement that lies about 30% above this minimum. Further improvement of confinement will lower the output, although in some cases the β limit will be the limiting factor. Given that for maximum performance density the confinement and fuel mix are best chosen to be optimal, the particle confinement is proposed as an attractive parameter for burn control.","Fusion energy is difficult because the output power is inversely proportional to particle confinement time, and improving confinement can lower output due to the choking effect of helium accumulation.",question,1137,200.0

In the present study, Wistar rats were subjected to moderate intensity treadmill exercise for 6 months prior to sacrifice at 12-, 24- and 32-month of age. This chronic physical intervention was tested on motility in the Open field (OF). Cognitive functions were measured in the Morris water maze (MWM) for spatial learning and in the Novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Since learning and memory are closely associated with cholinergic forebrain function ChAT fiber density after exercise training was assessed in hippocampus, and motor- and somatosensory cortical areas. Furthermore, quantification of ChAT-positive fiber aberrations as a neuropathological marker was also carried out in these brain areas. Our results show that in OF chronic exercise maintained horizontal locomotor activity in all age groups. Rearing activity, MWM and notably NOR performance were improved only in the 32-months old animals. Regarding cholinergic neuronal innervation, apart from a general age-related decline, exercise increased ChAT fiber density in the hippocampus CA1 area and in the motor cortex notably in the 32-months group. Massive ChAT fiber aberrations in all investigated areas which developed in senescence were clearly attenuated by exercise. The results suggest that moderate intensity chronic exercise in the rat is especially beneficial in advanced age.

2080,what is the characteristic of breast cancer brain metastasis?,[A retrospective analysis of clinic-pathological characteristics and prognostic factor for 137 cases of breast cancer brain metastasis].,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in breast cancer with brain metastasis (BCBM).


METHODS
The clinical data of 137 BCBM from June 2002 to June 2008 was reviewed and analyzed. Their molecular subtypes were categorized based on detection of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression. The focal area included 35 cases of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 38 cases of HR (ER and PR) (-)/HER-2(+), 40 cases of HR(+)/HER-2(-), 24 cases of HR(+)/HER-2(+). The clinical characteristics and the outcome in patients with influence were analyzed.


RESULTS
In 137 BCBM, the median overal survival after brain metastasis was 6.5 month. The median survivals of TNBC, HR(-)/HER-2(+), HR(+)/HER-2(-) and HR(+)/HER-2(+) were 5.0, 5.5, 10.0 and 9.5 months, respectively. The median survivals after brain metastasis of the breast cancer patients who received the combination therapy of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and neurosurgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery, received WBRT but not combination therapy and didn't receive WBRT were 15.0, 9.5 and 4.0 months, respectively. In univariate survival analysis, substyle, number of brain metastasis, brain metastasis as initial recurrence or not, brain-only metastases or not, the combination therapy status after brain metastasis were obviously correlated with the prognosis (χ(2) = 6.891 to 29.414, P < 0.05). Substyle (RR = 1.234, 95%CI: 1.057 to 1.440) and the combination therapy status after brain metastasis (RR = 1.838, 95%CI: 1.389 to 2.431) were independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
TNBC confers a high risk of death after brain metastases. Systemic treatment via combined modalities are helpful for breast cancer patients, even after the detection of brain metastases.","TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) has a high risk of death after brain metastases, and combined treatment modalities are helpful for patients even after detecting brain metastases.",question,1885,183.0
21125,does l-carnitine work?,Role of Carnitine in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Other Related Diseases: An Update,"Carnitine is an amino acid-derived substance that coordinates a wide range of biological processes. Such functions include transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix, regulation of acetyl-CoA/CoA, control of inter-organellar acyl traffic, and protection against oxidative stress. Recent studies have found that carnitine plays an important role in several diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, its effect is still controversial, and its mechanism is not clear. Herein, this review provides current knowledge on the biological functions of carnitine, the “multiple hit” impact of carnitine on the NAFLD progression, and the downstream mechanisms. Based on the “multiple hit” hypothesis, carnitine inhibits β-oxidation, improves mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduces insulin resistance to ameliorate NAFLD. L-carnitine may have therapeutic role in liver diseases including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis. We also discuss the prospects of L-carnitine supplementation as a therapeutic strategy in NAFLD and related diseases, and the factors limiting its widespread use.","L-carnitine may have a therapeutic role in liver diseases and ameliorate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by inhibiting β-oxidation, improving mitochondrial dysfunction, and reducing insulin resistance.",question,1228,203.0

12062,Does creatine improve cognition?,Effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive function of healthy individuals: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Background and aims: Creatine is a supplement used by sportsmen to increase athletic performance by improving energy supply to muscle tissues. It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals. Methods: A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals. Results: Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long‐term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat‐eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed. Conclusions: Oral creatine administration may improve short‐term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes. It is imperative that creatine should be tested on patients with dementias or cognitive impairment.

Traditionally, in the treatment of PKU, breastfeeding is replaced by formula milk. This study verified the effects of breastfeeding as a source of phenylalanine on the development of children with PKU. Participants were ten infants with PKU who started treatment with the introduction of formula before 30 days of life, and maintained breastfeeding for at least 30 days after the start of procedures. The procedures were based on estimating breast milk intake, with a safe margin of phenylalanine concentration, calculating stomach volume, and initially offering formula, then breastfeeding on free demand, at every feeding. Breastfeeding duration ranged from one month and five days to 14 months. Blood controls were tested weekly. If the serum level of phenylalanine was >2 mg/dL and 2 mg/dL, the formula was decreased by 25%, indirectly increasing breastfeeding; if it was <6 mg/dL the formula was increased by 50%. The phenylalanine levels were assessed, and the Early Milestone Scale and the Basic Steps of Development were applied. Those who had normative index in all evaluations were considered adequate. Eighty percent of infants were able to keep safe concentrations of phenylalanine and development within normal indices. Continued breastfeeding is viable in the treatment of children with PKU, provided that phenylalanine levels are strictly controlled and the effects of breastfeeding on child development are monitored.","Eighty percent of infants with PKU were able to maintain safe concentrations of phenylalanine and normal development while continuing breastfeeding, with strict control of phenylalanine levels.",question,1565,193.0

372,structure is already damaged by fire and earthquake occurred,Fire after earthquake robustness evaluation and design: Application to steel structures,"The occurrence of fires breaking out during a seismic event, or even delayed after an earthquake represents a common circumstance in earthquake prone Countries, which must be adequately taken into account as a possible design scenario. In fact the behaviour in fire of structures that have been damaged by earthquakes changes as respect to the undamaged ones, since the earthquake‐induced damage makes the structure more vulnerable to fire effects. In view of the current seismic design approach, where a certain extent of damage in case of severe earthquake is acceptable, the analysis of the behaviour of structures under the effect of fires in combination or following an earthquake is a significant research field, which is not yet fully explored. The robustness assessment under fire of structures already damaged to different extent by the seism, through a performance – based approach, is required. The procedure should be valuable as a design tool, as well as a vulnerability evaluation of the built heritage against FFE.

One form of physical activity which can be used with success in people with autism is aquatic activity. The objective of this systematic review study is to collect and analyze studies of the effects of aquatic activity on improving physical fitness and aquatic skills in children with autism. Based on an analysis of electronic databases and the inclusion criteria set, 13 studies were included in the analysis. The following conclusions are proposed based on their analysis: In terms of influence on aquatic skills, aquatic programs at least 10 weeks in duration can effect improvement in aquatic skills in children with autism, by means of learning methods well-used with autistic children, such as the Constant delay procedure, Most to least prompting procedure, and assistance from siblings and peers.

18357,benefits of binaural beats,The effect of 40 Hz binaural beats on working memory,"Binaural beats (BB), in which pure tones are delivered at fixed frequency, seek to influence neural activity during cognitive tasks and induce frequency-following response which can entrain brain rhythms to the frequency of external stimulation. An increasing number of studies have suggested that BB can be used to alter or enhance cognitive processes. This study aimed to explore the effect of 40 Hz binaural beats on working memory. In addition to further verifying whether there was a frequency-following response, changes in microstates were observed, providing new evidence for the effectiveness of binaural beats. 40 healthy volunteers completed visuospatial and verbal working memory tasks when listening to pink noise and 40 Hz binaural beats (R: 440 Hz, L: 400 Hz). The EEG was analyzed in terms of behavioral performance, relative power, Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and microstates after BB stimulation. We found that subjects performed better on the working memory task when stimulated by 40 Hz binaural beats, with significantly higher HFD in the temporal and parietal lobes and a significant positive correlation between HFD and relative power in the gamma band, in addition to a significant increase in the duration and coverage of microstate D and a significant decrease in those of microstate A. Our results demonstrate that 40 Hz binaural beats improve working memory, and induce frequency-following responses. Besides, changes in both HFD and microstates are correlated with attention, which may also account for the changes in working memory performance affected by 40 Hz binaural beats.","40 Hz binaural beats improve working memory and induce frequency-following responses, which may also account for changes in attention.",phrase,1611,134.0
13833,what is role of group rituals (collins theory) in tacit knowledge,Emile Durkheim and Erving Goffman Meet Dr. Magneto,"Theorists should stick their necks out if they expect to see things that others haven’t. Randall Collins aims to oblige. The goal of interaction ritual theory, he says, is to “explain what any individual will do, at any moment in time; what he or she will feel, think, and say” (p. 45). This is, he tells us, “a full-scale social psychology, not only of emotions and situational behavior, but of cognition” (p. 44). Even more, Collins says he’s laying out a program for “a sociology to dream about” (p. 99). So if there’s one thing not in short supply here, it’s ambition. Collins’s theory, in a nutshell, goes like this: ritual interaction—which includes everything from special ceremonies to everyday conversation—charges people up with emotional energy; humans are naturally motivated to seek emotional energy, and so they will be magnetically drawn to situations that provide it; the social world is a marketplace of situations in which people seek the highest payoff of emotional energy they can get, considering the resources they have to work with; and, when people think about what to do in this marketplace of situations, their thoughts are pulled along magnetically by","Interaction ritual theory explains that ritual interaction, including everyday conversation, charges people with emotional energy, influencing their thoughts and behavior in social situations.",question,1178,192.0

Consequently, the higher education system of Taiwan has evolved from an elite system to a universal one. The rapid expansion of higher education is also characterized by salient features such as the increase of higher degrees, an enlarged private sector, and diminishing numbers of junior college institutions and students. This study explores whether these changes at the national level have brought challenges to the labour market.

Method: In all, 62 patients with stroke who were admitted to the rehabilitation ward were randomly assigned to two groups: 33 patients to the intervention group and 29 to the control group. The OHCP, including tooth brushing education and professional tooth cleaning, was administered to the intervention group twice a week six times during in-hospital rehabilitation. Oral health status was examined both at baseline and three months after discharge from the hospital. Oral hygiene status was examined at three- to four-day intervals five times during the hospitalization period. Results: After OHCP, oral hygiene status including the plaque index, calculus index, and O’Leary plaque index improved significantly in the intervention group, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In the intervention group, after administration of the OHCP for the fourth time, the O’Leary index improved significantly, and remained high when checked three months after discharge (p < 0.001). Conclusions: An OHCP conducted during in-hospital rehabilitation was effective in improving oral health and plaque control performance among patients with stroke, with effects still seen three months after discharge from the hospital. Implications for Rehabilitation Initial oral hygiene status and plaque control performance were poor in stroke patients who were in rehabilitation center.

22750,why the sky is blue?,Skylight Polarization patterns and Animal Orientation,"1.Although many invertebrate animals orient by means of ultraviolet sky-light polarization patterns, existing measurements of these patterns are inadequate for full analysis of the biologically relevant information available from the sky. To fill this gap we have used a precision scanning polarimeter to measure simultaneously the intensity, degree, and direction of vibration (E-vector orientation) of polarized light at 5° intervals over the sky. The resulting sky maps were constructed for u.v. (350 nm) and visible wavelengths (500 and 650 nm) under a variety of atmospheric conditions. 2.Our measurements confirmed that the patterns of radiance and degree of polarization of skylight are highly variable and hence unreliable as orientation cues; but patterns of E-vector orientation are relatively stable and predictable over most of the sky under all but very hazy or overcast conditions. 3.The observed E-vector patterns correspond more closely to predictions based on first order (Rayleigh) scattering at 650 and 500 nm than at 350 nm. This is true both in terms of absolute accuracy and the proportion of the sky with relatively ‘correct’ information. Yet most insects respond to polarization patterns only at u.v. wavelengths. This apparent paradox can perhaps be resolved by assuming that there is no great selective advantage for any particular wavelength when large areas of blue sky are visible, but that under special and difficult conditions ultraviolet has advantages over longer wavelengths. Measurements under partially cloud-covered sky, for instance, or under extensive vegetation, show that both spuriously polarized and unpolarized light resulting from reflexions present more troublesome interference at longer wavelengths than in the u.v. 4.The accuracy of orientation achieved by dancing honey bees appears to be greater than can readily be accounted for by assuming that they use a strictly geometrical or analytical processing system for their orientation to polarized light.",Ultraviolet sky-light polarization patterns are unreliable for orientation cues,question,2004,79.0
23642,what are market entry strategies?,A system dynamics model as a decision aid in evaluating and communicating complex market entry strategies,"Abstract Developing a market entry strategy is a critical activity for any firm but all the more so for those firms that wish to successfully compete in today's challenging global economy. Unfortunately, developing a market entry strategy is an ill-structured and complex activity for which structured approaches have proven inadequate. In less structured situations, data driven and model based decision-support systems (DSS) have been shown to be of significant help to decision-makers faced with such tasks. Getting managers to use such systems, however, is a major challenge that has been the subject of considerable research in the field of DSS. As far back as the 1970's scholars identified reasons why managers are reluctant to use such systems. Among the most often cited reasons why managers are reluctant to use these systems are: they do not understand the model inherent in the DSS; they do not know when to use them; they are unable to extend the use of the DSS; or they are unable to explain the model or its output to others. This paper describes the process of building a system dynamics model that can be employed by marketing managers to help them test the effectiveness of different market entry strategies, and equally important to help them to explain the system's logic and output. The model was built in a bottom-up fashion with the help of a team of marketing managers. In this way the team that helped build the model not only felt a sense of ownership concerning the model, but were also be able to better explain and defend their proposed strategy.",A system dynamics model can help marketing managers test the effectiveness of different market entry strategies and explain the system's logic and output.,question,1575,154.0

4081,does human development increase carbon emissions?,Pathways of human development and carbon emissions embodied in trade,"how the relationship between human development and carbon changes when we adjust national emission rates for trade. Without such adjustment of emissions, some nations seem to be getting far better development ‘bang’ for the carbon ‘buck’ than others, who are showing scant gains for disproportionate shares of global emissions. Adjusting for the transfer of emissions through trade explains many of these outliers, but shows that further socio-economic benefits are accruing to carbon-importing rather than carbon-exporting countries. We also find that high life expectancies are compatible with low carbon emissions but high incomes are not. Finally, we see that, despite strong international trends, there is no deterministic industrial development trajectory: there is great diversity in pathways, and national histories do not necessarily follow the global trends. Seriously addressing climate change requires drastically cutting carbon emissions. To ‘avoid dangerous climate change’ 2 would require rapid reductions in emissions, from 1.2tC per capita on average in 2005 (ref. 3) to well below 1tC per capita by 2050, with proposals ranging from 0.35 to 0.2tC per capita (refs 4,5).

2581,how do i reduce ldl cholesterol?,Reducing coronary risk by raising HDL-cholesterol: risk modelling the addition of nicotinic acid to existing therapy,"ABSTRACT Background and objectives: Reduction in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) forms one of the principal objectives of most cardiovascular secondary prevention strategies. Many patients being treated with statins, however, have significant residual dyslipidaemia, with many having suboptimal HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The addition of nicotinic acid to a statin has been shown to improve this profile, although clinical outcome evidence is currently lacking. This study set out to model the impact of nicotinic acid therapy on cardiovascular risk in these patients, based on Framingham risk assessments on a cohort of patients drawn from UK general practitioner records. Methods: Cardiovascular risk profiles were extracted from a research database of 602 222 patients from 98 UK general practices. 23 262 statin-treated patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes were identified and their 4-year Framingham risk was estimated. Patients who had either TC or HDL-C outside the desirable range then had their lipid profile adjusted in accordance with the likely performance of nicotinic acid, and the Framingham risk was then re-assessed. Results: Baseline 4-year coronary risk in the group as a whole was 11.5% (95%CI: 11.4–11.6). After adjustment of the lipid profile, this was reduced to 9.7% (95%CI: 9.6–9.8), a reduction in risk of 15.9% (95%CI: 15.1–16.6). When modelling was limited to those with diabetes or an abnormal treated lipid profile, the magnitude of change was increased to 23–29% depending on sex and subgroup. Conclusions: Risk factor modelling suggests that raising HDL-C levels using nicotinic acid in statin-treated patients is likely to yield significant incremental clinical benefits. The results of clinical trials currently under way are awaited with interest.",Adding nicotinic acid to statin therapy may improve lipid profile and reduce cardiovascular risk by raising HDL-cholesterol levels.,question,1830,131.0

Materials and Methods: Data were collected from the 140 patients who were classified and treated in two groups, Group A (n=70) with single-visit obturation and Group B (n=70) with two-visit obturation. Results: In this study, it was observed that post-operative pain related with single-visit (Group A) RCT was overall similar as the post-operative pain associated with two-visit (Group B) treatment. In this study, sterile cotton pellet was positioned in the root canals between visits. Discussion: In this comparative study, under the studied conditions no difference in post-operative pain between patients treated in single-visit and patients treated in two-visit was observed. Thus, the present study demonstrates that two-visit endodontics is not helpful in reducing the pain incidence and that RCT completion in single-visit can be safe.",Single-visit root canal treatment can be safe and does not result in more post-operative pain compared to two-visit treatment.,question,1370,126.0
24310,do essential oils work?,ISOLASI DAN IDENTIFIKASI RIMPANG TEMULAWAK (Curcuma xanthorrohza Roxb.) DAN BUNGA LAVENDER (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.),"Essential oils are fragrance agents in plants. Essential oils have a volatile component in some plants with certain characteristics. At present, essential oils have been used as perfume, cosmetics, food additives and medicine. Empiric ethnopharmacology studies on aromatherapy plants show that Indonesia has 49 types of aromatic plants from 22 types of tribes, 12 of which are empirically used as aromatherapy with calming and refreshing effects (Sangat 1996 in Rahmawati, 2010). One example of aromatherapy used is the ginger rhizome (Curcuma xanthorrihza Roxb) and Lavender Flower (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). 
This study aims to isolate and identify the essential oils of Temulawak rhizome (Curcuma xanthorrihza Roxb) and Lavender Flowers (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). The essential oil isolation step uses the Steam Water Distillation method, after which the essential oil obtained is identified to ensure its purity. The results showed that Temulawak essential oil and Lavender essential oil were carried out using the water distillation method, obtained levels of 2.3% and 1.8%. Essential oils in Temulawak were identified by testing their physical properties which include specific gravity, solubility in ethanol 90%, solubility in chloroform and oil in NaCl. The identification results obtained in the Temulawak rhizome and Lavender plants are specific gravity 0.9436 and 0.8221.

19199,how long does it take for liposomes to release their content?,Kinetics of the micelle-to-vesicle transition: aqueous lecithin-bile salt mixtures.,"Important routes to lipid vesicles (liposomes) are detergent removal techniques, such as dialysis or dilution. Although they are widely applied, there has been only limited understanding about the structural evolution during the formation of vesicles and the parameters that determine their properties. We use time-resolved static and dynamic light scattering to study vesicle formation in aqueous lecithin-bile salt mixtures. The kinetic rates and vesicle sizes are found to strongly depend on total amphiphile concentration and, even more pronounced, on ionic strength. The observed trends contradict equilibrium calculations, but are in agreement with a kinetic model that we present. This model identifies the key kinetic steps during vesicle formation: rapid formation of disk-like intermediate micelles, growth of these metastable micelles, and their closure to form vesicles once line tension dominates bending energy. A comparison of the rates of growth and closure provides a kinetic criterion for the critical size at which disks close and thus for the vesicle size. The model suggests that liposomes are nonequilibrium, kinetically trapped structures of very long lifetime. Their properties are hence controlled by kinetics rather than thermodynamics.","Liposomes are nonequilibrium, kinetically trapped structures with very long lifetimes, suggesting their properties are controlled by kinetics rather than thermodynamics.",question,1262,169.0

This study aimed to replicate and expand on previous findings reported in young adults. Participants (N = 30; mean age = 23.4 SD = 5.6) attended three experimental sessions. Each session consisted of baseline measures of mood and cognitive performance, followed by a counterbalanced intervention period of either no water, 500 mL non-chilled or chilled water. Twenty minutes after water consumption, the mood questionnaires and cognitive tasks were repeated. Our results showed that individuals reported feeling more attentive and less fatigued after water consumption compared with the no water condition. No significant changes in cognitive performance were found due to water intervention. These results corroborate previous water supplementation studies in young adults with respect to subjective mood changes.

This chapter presents a perspective in which moral development is a process of constructions involving thought and emotions arising from bidirectional interactions with the environment. Morality is a domain entailing understandings of welfare, justice, and rights. The moral domain is formed along with the distinct domains of understandings of social conventions in social systems and arenas of personal jurisdiction. As part of individuals' reflective thought processes, their decisions often involve weighing and balancing considerations from different domains and opposing practices seen as unfair.

4810,advantages of keto diet over caloric restriction,Caloric restriction augments brain glutamic acid decarboxylase‐65 and ‐67 expression,"The ketogenic diet is a very low‐carbohydrate, high‐fat diet used to treat refractory epilepsy. We hypothesized that this diet may act by increasing expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate‐limiting enzyme in γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis. Thus, we evaluated brain GAD levels in a well‐established, seizure‐suppressing, rodent model of the ketogenic diet. Because the diet is most effective when administered with a modest (∼10%) calorie restriction, we studied three groups of animals: rats fed ad libitum standard rat chow (Ad lib‐Std); calorie‐restricted standard chow (CR‐Std); and an isocaloric, calorie‐restricted ketogenic diet (CR‐Ket). We found that GAD67 mRNA was significantly increased in the inferior and superior colliculi and cerebellar cortex in both CR diet groups compared with control (e.g., by 45% in the superior colliculus and by 71% in the cerebellar cortex; P < .001). GAD65 mRNA was selectively increased in the superior colliculus and temporal cortex in both CR‐Std and CR‐Ket diet groups compared with ad lib controls. The only apparent CR‐Ket‐specific effect was a 30% increase in GAD67 mRNA in the striatum (P = .03). Enhanced GAD immunoreactivity was detected in parallel with the mRNA changes. These data clearly show that calorie restriction increases brain GAD65 and ‐67 expression in several brain regions, independent of ketogenic effects. These observations may explain why caloric restriction improves the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in treating epilepsy and suggest that diet modification might be useful in treatment of a number of brain disorders characterized by impaired GAD or GABA activity. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","Caloric restriction increases brain GAD65 and GAD67 expression in several brain regions, which may improve the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in treating epilepsy.",phrase,1685,163.0

1165,is lgbtq+ care being taught in pharmacy schools,Hetero - and cisnormativity - UK pharmacy education as a queer opponent.,"INTRODUCTION
Queer pedagogy is a lens through which the hegemonic discourses of curricula and the heterosexual assumptions within them can be made visible. Using this lens, sexuality and gender norms incorporated in undergraduate medical and health curricula can be located and the lived experience of a curriculum considered. This paper seeks to determine the extent of hetero/cisnormativity within UK pharmacy education with the aim of problematising the normalisation of heterosexuality; following this, strategies to disrupt structured hetero/cisnormativity are considered.


METHODS
Online cross-sectional surveys were distributed to course leads (n=29) and students enrolled on undergraduate pharmacy (MPharm) programmes. Surveys captured quantitative data on curriculum design and perceived barriers to implementation of inclusive curriculum design (the espoused LGBTQI+ curriculum), as well qualitative data on the lived experience of the hidden curriculum. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data were analysed thematically.


RESULTS
Responses were received from 19 course leads and students from 25 MPharm programmes, representing varying completion rates. Findings suggest the shared values and goals of pharmacy education act to normalise and legitimise hetero and cis identities within curriculum design, that othering as a consequence of heterosexual normativity is experienced and that pharmacy education is an LGBTQI+ opponent and does not adopt an ally attitude. Moreover, both educator and student data suggest that the enacted and experienced curriculum fails to prepare learners to care for LGBTQI+ people.


DISCUSSION
Despite findings suggesting the espoused or enacted curriculum absents LGBTQI+ people, and the hidden curriculum is experienced as homonegative, learners are questioning, resisting and disrupting the hetero- and cis-normative benevolent heterosexism within UK pharmacy curricula. This method of curricula interrogation can be adopted across health professions education as a means for ongoing problematising and disruption of normativity in clinical education.",UK pharmacy education normalizes hetero and cis identities and fails to prepare learners to care for LGBTQI+ people.,question,2146,116.0

9865,is climate changed caused by humans?,"Mammoth tracks indicate a declining Late Pleistocene population in southwestern Alberta, Canada","Abstract Much debate has raged over the role that early humans played in this most recent large extinction. Fossil mammoth ( Mammuthus primigenius ) footprints were discovered at the St. Mary Reservoir in southwestern Canada (Wally's Beach DhPg-8). They are located in aeolian sediment dated at 11,300–11,000 years BP. By comparing the size distribution of these tracks with those of modern African elephants ( Loxodonta africana ), the age distribution of this mammoth population was determined. Containing far fewer juveniles than would be expected for an expanding or stable population, these tracks provide the first evidence that a living mammoth population, coexisting with human inhabitants, was in decline. Additionally, the same site provides corroborating evidence of humans hunting megafauna (horse and bovids).

1151,do conscientious objection laws harm sexual minority health?,A Matter of Conscience: Examining the Law and Policy of Conscientious Objection in Health Care,"Conscientious objection refers to refusal by a health care provider (HCP) to provide certain treatments, including the standard of care, to a patient based upon the provider’s personal, ethical, or religious beliefs. Federal and state rules regarding conscientious objection have expanded the scope of legal protections that HCPs and institutions can invoke in support of refusal. Opponents of these rules argue that allowing refusal of care deprives patients of care that conforms to professionally established guidelines, contradicts long-standing principles related to informed consent, interferes with the ability of health care facilities to provide safe and efficient care, and leaves the patient without means of redress for injury. Proponents respond that such rules are necessary to preserve the moral integrity of providers, including institutions. Although refusal rules are most often associated with abortion, some HCPs have cited moral concerns regarding contraception, sterilization, prevention/treatment of sexually transmitted infections, transition-related care for transgender individuals, medication-assisted treatment of substance use disorders, the use of artificial reproductive technologies, and patient preferences for end-of-life care. Evidence suggests that the burden of conscientious refusal falls disproportionately on vulnerable populations, and legitimate concern exists that moral disagreement is merely pretext for discrimination. A careful balance must be struck between the defending the conscience rights of HCPs and the civil rights of patients.","Conscientious objection in healthcare disproportionately burdens vulnerable populations and may serve as a pretext for discrimination, potentially harming sexual minority health.",question,1583,178.0

22018,does cbd help with anxiety?,Cannabidiol Reduces the Anxiety Induced by Simulated Public Speaking in Treatment-Naïve Social Phobia Patients,"Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is one of the most common anxiety conditions with impairment in social life. Cannabidiol (CBD), one major non-psychotomimetic compound of the cannabis sativa plant, has shown anxiolytic effects both in humans and in animals. This preliminary study aimed to compare the effects of a simulation public speaking test (SPST) on healthy control (HC) patients and treatment-naïve SAD patients who received a single dose of CBD or placebo. A total of 24 never-treated patients with SAD were allocated to receive either CBD (600 mg; n=12) or placebo (placebo; n=12) in a double-blind randomized design 1 h and a half before the test. The same number of HC (n=12) performed the SPST without receiving any medication. Each volunteer participated in only one experimental session in a double-blind procedure. Subjective ratings on the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) and Negative Self-Statement scale (SSPS-N) and physiological measures (blood pressure, heart rate, and skin conductance) were measured at six different time points during the SPST. The results were submitted to a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Pretreatment with CBD significantly reduced anxiety, cognitive impairment and discomfort in their speech performance, and significantly decreased alert in their anticipatory speech. The placebo group presented higher anxiety, cognitive impairment, discomfort, and alert levels when compared with the control group as assessed with the VAMS. The SSPS-N scores evidenced significant increases during the testing of placebo group that was almost abolished in the CBD group. No significant differences were observed between CBD and HC in SSPS-N scores or in the cognitive impairment, discomfort, and alert factors of VAMS. The increase in anxiety induced by the SPST on subjects with SAD was reduced with the use of CBD, resulting in a similar response as the HC.","CBD significantly reduced anxiety, cognitive impairment, and discomfort in speech performance for individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder during a simulated public speaking test.",question,1912,179.0
1231,the impact of currency fluctuations on selected agricultural export commodities in nigeria,Does Exchange Rate Devaluation Affect Agricultural Output? Evidence from Nigeria,"The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of exchange rate devaluation on agricultural output in Nigeria. This investigation used the available time series data of 30 years (1986-2016) from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin and the National Bureau of Statistics. Moreover, the real effective exchange rate was used as the proxy for currency devaluation and Consumer Price Index (CPI) was used as a proxy for inflation. Other variables were Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP), Price of Export (PEXP), and Real Agricultural Exports (RAEXP). The research through the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Philip Perron’s unit root tests find that the variables used in the model are integrated in the same order. Using the Johansen’s cointegration test results show that the variables are cointegrated. The results of the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) indicates that a percent increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), a proxy for devaluation. It will lead to a decrease in gross agricultural output. This implies that total agricultural output responds negatively to exchange rate devaluation. The result of the causality test by Toda and Yamamoto reveals that a unidirectional causality exists between real effective exchange rate and price of exports. This shows that a significant relationship exists between exchange rate devaluation and gross exports earnings. It reveals that the past values of the price of exports can be used to predict the current values of agricultural output.",Exchange rate devaluation leads to a decrease in gross agricultural output in Nigeria.,phrase,1541,86.0
17042,climate change effect on agriculture,Agriculture and climate change,"Climate change includes higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The Greenhouse effect may be important for agriculture in three different ways (1) by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations which may effect directly on the growth rate of crop plants as well as weeds (2) CO2-induced changes of climate may alter levels of temperature, rainfall and sunshine which manipulates plant and animal productivity and (3) increases flood area by rises in sea level. Climate change is the most serious environmental threat that negatively affects the farm produce. In agriculture, Green House Gas (GHG) emission is much more because of large number of cattle and poor manure management, rude use of agro-chemicals and land mismanagement. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are two of the main potent non-CO2 GHG, which contributes about half of the global emissions of the world. Emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) arises directly from nitrogen (N) applied to the soil or indirectly from nitrates, whether it may be in the form of fertilizer, manure, crop residues or nitrogen fixation. There are two processes, Nitrate leaching or ammonia volatilization which will be successful measures to reduce farming emissions. India has wide range of variations in climate, ranging from tropical to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan. As the temperature and resource availability varies between different countries it results in variation of agricultural contribution to climate change. In present paper we are concerned with the contribution of Agricultural Activities to Climate Change, its causes, impact as well as mitigation strategies. Therefore, contribution of agricultural activities to climate change, its causes, impact as well as mitigation strategies need to be addressed for sustaining agricultural","Climate change negatively affects agriculture by altering temperature, rainfall, and sunshine, which impacts plant and animal productivity, and increasing flood areas due to rising sea levels.",phrase,1848,192.0

CXCR6+ T cells are known to traffic to the lung and have been reported to increase with age. The ligand of CXCR6, CXCL16, is constitutively expressed in the lung and upregulated during inflammatory responses and the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis is associated with severe lung disease and pneumonia. Genome-wide association studies have also recently identified 3p21.31, encompassing the CXCR6 gene, as a susceptibility locus for severe COVID-19. We assessed numbers T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR6 and plasma levels of CXCL16, in control and COVID-19 patients. Results demonstrated that circulating CD8+CXCR6+ T cells were significantly elevated with advancing age, yet virtually absent in patients with severe COVID-19. Peripheral levels of CXCL16 were significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients compared to either mild COVID-19 patients or SARS-CoV-2 negative controls.

21063,what does current epidemiology say about mdd depression in canada,"Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. I. Classification, burden and principles of management.","BACKGROUND
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most burdensome illnesses in Canada. The purpose of this introductory section of the 2009 revised CANMAT guidelines is to provide definitions of the depressive disorders (with an emphasis on MDD), summarize Canadian data concerning their epidemiology and describe overarching principles of managing these conditions. This section on ""Classification, Burden and Principles of Management"" is one of 5 guideline articles in the 2009 CANMAT guidelines.


METHODS
The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to the Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support.


RESULTS
Epidemiologic data indicate that MDD afflicts 11% of Canadians at some time in their lives, and approximately 4% during any given year. MDD has a detrimental impact on overall health, role functioning and quality of life. Detection of MDD, accurate diagnosis and provision of evidence-based treatment are challenging tasks for both clinicians and for the health systems in which they work.


LIMITATIONS
Epidemiologic and clinical data cannot be seamlessly linked due to heterogeneity of syndromes within the population.


CONCLUSIONS
In the eight years since the last CANMAT Guidelines for Treatment of Depressive Disorders were published, progress has been made in understanding the epidemiology and treatment of these disorders. Evidence supporting specific therapeutic interventions is summarized and evaluated in subsequent sections.","MDD affects 11% of Canadians at some time in their lives, and approximately 4% during any given year.",question,1748,101.0

A particularly vulnerable group is emerging adults (age 18–25 years). As more emerging adults are seeking help and entering a recovery process, relevant studies on their experiences in recovery increases. Although the definition of abstinence-based recovery is debated, the factors of hope and coping are important related to this dialogue. This phenomenology explores the experience of emerging adults in recovery who are members of a collegiate recovery program. Through interviews, eight participants described their recovery experience with a focus on hope and coping. Categories and themes related to participants’ experience of recovery in relation to hope and coping are reported.

24257,is mdma safe for consumption?,An Exploration of the History and Controversies Surrounding MDMA and MDA,"Abstract In existence for nearly a century, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “Ecstasy”) have gained quite a reputation. Perceived by some as dangerous neurotoxins, and by others as potential psychotherapeutics, these compounds have become a center of controversy among academics and law enforcement officials, and in the process have gained extensive media exposure. The classification of these drugs as illicit, controlled substances in the United States has not prevented their use, and MDMA, or Ecstasy, is currently one of the most popular substances used recreationally in North America. The scheduling of MDMA and MDA has, however, led to the distribution of contaminated, or falsely represented, Ecstasy tablets, and prevented responsible research into the detrimental and therapeutic effects of these drugs. A look at the history of these compounds suggests that they have the potential to be used safely as psychotherapeutic tools, and that the legal status of MDMA and MDA may be worth reconsidering.","The history of MDMA and MDA suggests they have the potential to be used safely as psychotherapeutic tools, but their legal status may need reconsideration.",question,1058,155.0
92,can mutant tp53 gene in colorectal cancer be reversed?,Targeting the Oncogenic p53 Mutants in Colorectal Cancer and Other Solid Tumors,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a kind of solid tumor and the third most common cancer type in the world. It is a heterogeneous disease characterized by genetic and epigenetic aberrations. The TP53 mutation is the key step driving the transition from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. The functional roles of TP53 mutation in tumor development have been comprehensively investigated. In CRC, TP53 mutation was associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. A gain of function (GOF) of p53 mutants promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion through multiple mechanisms. Restoring wild type p53 function, depleting p53 mutants, or intervention by targeting the oncogenic downstreams provides potential therapeutic strategies. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the GOF of p53 mutants in CRC progression as well as in some other solid tumors, and discuss the current strategies targeting p53 mutants in malignancies.","Restoring wild type p53 function, depleting p53 mutants, or targeting oncogenic downstreams are potential therapeutic strategies for mutant TP53 gene in colorectal cancer.",question,925,171.0

South American Aztec Indians referred to them as teonanacatl , meaning “god’s flesh,” and they were used in religious and healing rituals. Spanish missionaries in the 1500s attempted to destroy all records and evidence of the use of these mushrooms. Nevertheless, a 16th century Spanish Franciscan friar and historian mentioned teonanacatl in his extensive writings, intriguing 20th century ethnopharmacologists and leading to a decades-long search for the identity of teonanacatl . Their search ultimately led to a 1957 photo-essay in a popular magazine, describing for the Western world the use of these mushrooms. Specimens were ultimately obtained, and their active principle identified and chemically synthesized. In the past 10–15 years several FDA-approved clinical studies have indicated potential medical value for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating depression, anxiety, and certain addictions.

In the current study, we evaluated the protective effects of morel mushrooms against Cd-induced reproductive damages in rats. For this purpose, 30 male rats were divided into 6 groups (n=5/group), the first group served as the control group, second group was treated with an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of 1 mg/kg/day of Cd. Third and fourth groups were co-treated with 1 mg/kg/day of Cd (i.p) and 10 and 20 mg/kg/day of morel mushroom extract (orally) respectively. The final 2 groups received oral gavage of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day of morel mushroom extract alone. After treatment for 17 days, the animals were euthanized, and testes and epididymis were dissected out. One testis and epididymis of each animal were processed for histology, while the other testis and epididymis were used for daily sperm production (DSP) and comet assay. Our results showed that Cd and morel mushrooms have no effect on animal weight, but Cd significantly decreases the DSP count and damages the heritable DNA which is reversed in co-treatment groups. Similarly, the histopathological results of testes and epididymis show that morel mushrooms control the damage to these tissues. Whereas the morel mushroom extract alone could enhance the production of testosterone.

13327,is there unconscious semantic processing?,Partial Awareness Creates the “Illusion” of Subliminal Semantic Priming,"We argue that the lack of consensus regarding the existence of subliminal semantic processing arises from not taking into account the fact that linguistic stimuli are represented across several processing levels (features, letters, word form) that can independently reach or not reach awareness. Using masked words, we constructed conditions in which participants were aware of some letters or fragments of a word, while remaining unaware of the whole word. Three experiments using the Stroop priming paradigm show that when the stimulus set is reduced and participants are encouraged to guess the identity of the prime, such partially perceived stimuli can nonetheless give rise to “semantic” processing. We provide evidence that this effect is due to illusory reconstruction of the incompletely perceived stimulus, followed by usual semantic processing of the result. We conclude that previously reported unconscious Stroop priming is in fact a conscious effect, but applied to a perceptual illusion.",Unconscious Stroop priming is actually a conscious effect applied to a perceptual illusion.,question,1002,91.0

Push-pull-mooring theory was used as a guide, resulting in seven independent variables ( convenience , social influence , academic reasons , ease of use , social networking , barriers , and e-learning perception ), and one dependent variable ( teaching and learning benefit ). The study included a survey of 524 respondents (N Australia = 214; N Malaysia = 310). Path modeling analysis revealed three common factors between students from both countries: academic reasons, barriers, and social networking. However Malaysian students revealed a significant greater emphasis on academic reasons and barriers compared to their Australian counterparts. No significant difference was noted for social networking, suggesting that the use of social media as a means to maintain social interaction is popular regardless of cultural differences. Alternatively, significant effects were observed for convenience and e-learning perception among Australian students, while ease of use was found to have significant impact on Malaysian students.

13636,how to train embeddings for image similarity,Learning Representations Specialized in Spatial Knowledge: Leveraging Language and Vision,"Spatial understanding is crucial in many real-world problems, yet little progress has been made towards building representations that capture spatial knowledge. Here, we move one step forward in this direction and learn such representations by leveraging a task consisting in predicting continuous 2D spatial arrangements of objects given object-relationship-object instances (e.g., “cat under chair”) and a simple neural network model that learns the task from annotated images. We show that the model succeeds in this task and, furthermore, that it is capable of predicting correct spatial arrangements for unseen objects if either CNN features or word embeddings of the objects are provided. The differences between visual and linguistic features are discussed. Next, to evaluate the spatial representations learned in the previous task, we introduce a task and a dataset consisting in a set of crowdsourced human ratings of spatial similarity for object pairs. We find that both CNN (convolutional neural network) features and word embeddings predict human judgments of similarity well and that these vectors can be further specialized in spatial knowledge if we update them when training the model that predicts spatial arrangements of objects. Overall, this paper paves the way towards building distributed spatial representations, contributing to the understanding of spatial expressions in language.",Predicting correct spatial arrangements for unseen objects can be achieved using CNN features or word embeddings of the objects in a neural network model.,question,1407,154.0
14611,what is the relationship between inflation and economic growth in the covid-19 period?,Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Dan Inflasi Di Indonesia Pada Masa Pandemi,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused recessions in many countries around the world. This happened after economic growth in the first and second quarters of 2020. Some of the countries experiencing recession are Singapore, South Korea, Germany, Japan, France, Hong Kong, and the United States. If the economic growth in each quarter is also negative, Indonesia will experience a recession. The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) noted that Indonesia's economic growth rate fell to minus (5.32%) in the second quarter of 2020. Previously, Indonesia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 was 2.97% or started to slow down. Inflation is a tendency to increase the prices of goods and services in general, which continues continuously, which will reduce the purchasing power of the public, especially for low-income groups.

These new ionic liquid crystals develop single layer smectic-type mesophases with molecules tilted or orthogonal with respect to the smectic planes as a function of temperature. A high tendency to develop a homeotropic behavior was observed for the molecular liquid crystals. A molecular arrangement was proposed in which the different parts of molecules are fully segregated from one another with the ionic groups stabilizing the smectic order. These molecules show a luminescence in the blue region that combined with the liquid–crystalline behavior could be interesting for the fabrication of light emitting thin films with ordered molecular emitters.,"The molecular arrangement in ionic liquid crystals is determined by the segregation of different parts of molecules, with ionic groups stabilizing the smectic order.",question,786,165.0
2643,why baby facial emotion recognition is important?,Recognition of dynamic and static facial expressions of emotion among older adults with major depression.,"INTRODUCTION
The recognition of facial expressions of emotion is essential to living in society. However, individuals with major depression tend to interpret information considered imprecise in a negative light, which can exert a direct effect on their capacity to decode social stimuli.


OBJECTIVE
To compare basic facial expression recognition skills during tasks with static and dynamic stimuli in older adults with and without major depression.


METHODS
Older adults were selected through a screening process for psychiatric disorders at a primary care service. Psychiatric evaluations were performed using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). Twenty-three adults with a diagnosis of depression and 23 older adults without a psychiatric diagnosis were asked to perform two facial emotion recognition tasks using static and dynamic stimuli.


RESULTS
Individuals with major depression demonstrated greater accuracy in recognizing sadness (p=0.023) and anger (p=0.024) during the task with static stimuli and less accuracy in recognizing happiness during the task with dynamic stimuli (p=0.020). The impairment was mainly related to the recognition of emotions of lower intensity.


CONCLUSIONS
The performance of older adults with depression in facial expression recognition tasks with static and dynamic stimuli differs from that of older adults without depression, with greater accuracy regarding negative emotions (sadness and anger) and lower accuracy regarding the recognition of happiness.",Older adults with depression show greater accuracy in recognizing negative emotions (sadness and anger) and lower accuracy in recognizing happiness in facial expressions.,question,1557,170.0

12816,do breathing exercises help children with social and emotional difficulties?,Breathing Exercises in Asthma,"BREATHING EXERCISES IN ASTHMA? As Bruton and Thomas point out in their editorial accompanying the paper by Slader and colleagues, treatments involving manipulation of breathing are commonly used although the evidence base for their effectiveness is weak. In a double blind study Slader and colleagues compared the effects of breathing exercises learned from instructional videos and focusing on nasal breathing (group A) with those of non-specific upper body exercises (group B). For 30 weeks the asthmatic patients performed these exercises twice daily and no differences were observed between the groups in quality of life scores, lung function, or airway responsiveness. However, across both groups there was a dramatic fall in reliever use from week 1 after randomisation amounting to a total decrease in reliever use of 86% and a 50% decrease in the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The authors show that two different types of interventions lead to similar effects on asthma, especially relating to the use of short acting b2 agonist. No effect was observed on any parameters relating to airway inflammation. The authors conclude that the improvements observed in the asthmatics following breathing techniques are due to improved relaxation and self-efficacy leading to a reduction in inhaler use. Breathing techniques may therefore be appropriate in patients with mild asthma symptoms who use a reliever frequently. See pages 643 and 651 PREDICTORS OF COUGH IN CHILDREN Cough is very common in children, but paediatricians need to decide which children warrant further review and investigation. In this month’s Thorax, Marchant and colleagues describe a prospective cohort study of children referred to a tertiary hospital with cough lasting more than 3 weeks. The authors show that the most useful clinical marker in predicting cough is the presence of a daily moist cough at the time of consultation, and both chest examination and chest radiography were also helpful. A parental history of moist cough also predicted a specific cause of cough. In the accompanying editorial, Shields discusses some of the limitations of the study and points out that the study had a high frequency of bacterial bronchitis, a condition that requires further attention in children.

13600,does methamphetamine affect spatial learning in rodents,Levels of Neural Progenitors in the Hippocampus Predict Memory Impairment and Relapse to Drug Seeking as a Function of Excessive Methamphetamine Self-Administration,"Methamphetamine affects the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory, as well as relapse to drug seeking. Rats self-administered methamphetamine for 1 h twice weekly (intermittent-short-I-ShA), 1 h daily (limited-short-ShA), or 6 h daily (extended-long-LgA) for 22 sessions. After 22 sessions, rats from each access group were withdrawn from self-administration and underwent spatial memory (Y-maze) and working memory (T-maze) tests followed by extinction and reinstatement to methamphetamine seeking or received one intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label progenitors in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) during the synthesis phase. Two-hour-old and 28-day-old surviving BrdU-immunoreactive cells were quantified. I-ShA rats performed better on the Y-maze and had a greater number of 2-h-old SGZ BrdU cells than nondrug controls. LgA rats, but not ShA rats, performed worse on the Y- and T-maze and had a fewer number of 2-h-old SGZ BrdU cells than nondrug and I-ShA rats, suggesting that new hippocampal progenitors, decreased by methamphetamine, were correlated with impairment in the acquisition of new spatial cues. Analyses of addiction-related behaviors after withdrawal and extinction training revealed methamphetamine-primed reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking behavior in all three groups (I-ShA, ShA, and LgA), and this effect was enhanced in LgA rats compared with I-ShA and ShA rats. Protracted withdrawal from self-administration enhanced the survival of SGZ BrdU cells, and methamphetamine seeking during protracted withdrawal enhanced Fos expression in the dentate gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex in LgA rats to a greater extent than in ShA and I-ShA rats. These results indicate that changes in the levels of the proliferation and survival of hippocampal neural progenitors and neuronal activation of hippocampal granule cells predict the effects of methamphetamine self-administration (limited vs extended access) on cognitive performance and relapse to drug seeking and may contribute to the impairments that perpetuate the addiction cycle.","Methamphetamine use can impair spatial learning in rodents, as seen in worse performance on Y- and T-maze tests.",question,2121,112.0

In this study, pairs of participants were exposed to one of three kinds of auditory stimuli (rhythmic, arrhythmic, or white-noise) and subsequently engaged in five trials of a joint-action task demanding interpersonal coordination. We show that when compared with the other two stimuli, exposure to the rhythmic beat reduced the practice effect in task performance. Analysis of the behavioral data suggests that this reduction results from more temporally coupled motor movements over successive trials and that shared exposure to rhythm facilitates interpersonal motor coupling, which in this context serves to impede the attainment of necessary dynamic coordination. We propose that rhythm has the potential to enhance interpersonal motor coupling, which might serve as a mechanism behind its facilitation of positive social attitudes.","Exposure to rhythmic beats facilitates interpersonal motor coupling, which may enhance positive social attitudes.",question,1156,113.0

The radiation from mobile phones, cordless phones, mobile antennas, and many other devices pose health threats, especially when they are close to the body for extended period. In humans and animals, bioelectrical signals regulate many processes. Therefore, EMF radiations can interfere with the natural way of how our body works; it affects our body at cell level. Moreover, the impact of EMF radiation on our eco-system is serious due to growing number of broadcasting antennas, mobile communications base stations etc. World Health Organization (WHO) says the EMF radiations produced by mobile phone is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as possible carcinogen to humans. The aim of this research paper is to survey on mobile phone usage and EMF radiation awareness. Our results from analyzing the survey data shows that 86.2% people keep their mobile phones near their ears while receiving calls, 77.7% people keep mobile phones in their bedroom before going to bed. Based on the results and considering the major impact of EMF radiations, we propose innovative house design called Radiation Reduced Dwelling (RRD) by which the EMF radiation exposure can be minimized at home.

24033,why does my baby cry?,Inconsolable Crying in Infants: Differential Diagnosis in the Pediatric Emergency Department,"Crying is a part of the physiological neurodevelopment of an infant, ensuring survival and social interaction. The crying period reaches its peak at 6 to 8 weeks of life, with an average duration of 2.6 hours per day, after which it gradually decreases by the age of 3 to 4 months. Episodes of inconsolable crying typically tend to cluster during the evening, but may occur throughout the day, causing anxiety, fatigue, and concern in the caregiver. Therefore, it is not surprising that excessive crying is one of the most common symptoms in emergency departments, leading to approximately 20% of pediatric consultations of infants up to 3 months old. According to studies, an organic cause is revealed in only 5% of infants, with urinary tract infections being the most prevalent (in more than 50% of cases), especially in newborns. Other underlying etiologies are numerous, varying from simple general causes such as hunger or tiredness to severe life-threatening conditions. In most cases, the diagnosis can be set after taking a detailed medical history and performing a thorough clinical examination of the child.","Crying peaks at 6-8 weeks of life with an average duration of 2.6 hours per day, ensuring survival and social interaction.",question,1118,122.0
20642,is soy healthy?,Comprehensive evaluation of the role of soy and isoflavone supplementation in humans and animals over the past two decades,"Soy and soy‐based foods are considered healthy, particularly in many Asia–Pacific countries, where soy products have long been consumed. Soy and soy‐related products have been found to help prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. These products can also have antioxidative effects that alleviate hot flashes during menopause and bone loss. These biological and therapeutic functions are primarily due to the isoflavones derived from soy, whose structure is similar to the structure of 17‐β‐oestradiol. Despite the many health benefits for humans and animals, the application of isoflavones remains controversial because of their anti‐oestrogenic properties. We focused on general information regarding isoflavones, as well as their structure, function, and application. We summarized evidence showing that dietary or supplemental isoflavones exert protective effects on the health of humans and animals. Based on the literature, we conclude that soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe; however, more high‐quality trials are needed to fully substantiate their potential use.","Soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe, helping prevent cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and alleviating menopause symptoms and bone loss.",question,1161,160.0

 Stress and Modify Behavior in Canines and Felines: Implications for Human
 Use","Pets can both relieve and exacerbate human stress; humans can do the same for pets (Friedmann 2011, Young 2020). When companion animals experience chronic psychological stress, they become more prone to socially unacceptable behaviors, poor prognosis, pet euthanasia and worsened owner mental health (Dodman 2018, Pegram 2021). Such stress is also associated with medical symptoms like diarrhea and incontinence, and with conditions like atopic dermatitis (Horwitz 2018). These traits make the companion animal’s stress experience a useful, interdependent model for humans. If pet parents and clinicians have access to convenient, effective screening tools for stress, earlier and more affordable behavioral interventions can be conducted. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes screening interventions for stress-related conditions possible. Clinicians routinely collect data about stress in behavioral histories, but they have had limited ways of measuring it. AI offers new, efficient ways to quantify chronic psychological stress and understand its impact. Our team created Pet Happiness, an AI-enabled software program that analyzes behavioral history to generate psychological diagnoses in cats and dogs. Using online and teleconsulting interviews with pet owners, the platform’s AI, “PetTelligence,” reduces consulting inefficiencies and suggests the most useful behavioral interventions. The software is less expensive and may provide more consistent stress measurement than using invasive, unreliable biomarkers such as serum cortisol.

16382,do home crowds impact officiating?,The Impact of Crowd Noise on Officiating in Muay Thai: Achieving External Validity in an Experimental Setting,"Numerous factors have been proposed to explain the home advantage in sport. Several authors have suggested that a partisan home crowd enhances home advantage and that this is at least in part a consequence of their influence on officiating. However, while experimental studies examining this phenomenon have high levels of internal validity (since only the “crowd noise” intervention is allowed to vary), they suffer from a lack of external validity, with decision-making in a laboratory setting typically bearing little resemblance to decision-making in live sports settings. Conversely, observational and quasi-experimental studies with high levels of external validity suffer from low levels of internal validity as countless factors besides crowd noise vary. The present study provides a unique opportunity to address these criticisms, by conducting a controlled experiment on the impact of crowd noise on officiating in a live tournament setting. Seventeen qualified judges officiated on thirty Thai boxing bouts in a live international tournament setting featuring “home” and “away” boxers. In each bout, judges were randomized into a “noise” (live sound) or “no crowd noise” (noise-canceling headphones and white noise) condition, resulting in 59 judgments in the “no crowd noise” and 61 in the “crowd noise” condition. The results provide the first experimental evidence of the impact of live crowd noise on officials in sport. A cross-classified statistical model indicated that crowd noise had a statistically significant impact, equating to just over half a point per bout (in the context of five round bouts with the “10-point must” scoring system shared with professional boxing). The practical significance of the findings, their implications for officiating and for the future conduct of crowd noise studies are discussed.","Crowd noise had a statistically significant impact on officiating, equating to just over half a point per bout in a live tournament setting.",question,1837,140.0
4249,is the earth warming?,A perspective on climate change from Earth’s energy imbalance,"The Earth is warming from human activities, primarily because of increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere that reduce the outgoing infrared radiation from the planet escaping to space. This creates an energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) called Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI). It creates heating of the planet, which is manifested in multiple ways, only one of which is the rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST) (figure 1). The latter has been the primary focus for tracking global warming and 2021 was rated as the fifth or sixth highest on record, but the top 8 warmest years have all occurred since 2013 (figure 1). The EEI is arguably the most important metric related to climate change. It is the net result of all the processes and feedbacks in play in the climate system. However, it is also important to recognize the components of radiation at TOA, the absorbed solar radiation (ASR) and net outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The ASR is the net incoming after reflected radiation is accounted for and varies with clouds. The net EEI is the ASR-OLR. A key reason for this breakdown relates to proposed geoengineering, in particular, so-called solar radiation management (SRM), a euphemistic name if ever there was one (Trenberth 2022). SRM alters ASR while the problem is trapping of OLR. In between are all the weather systems and hydrological cycle. The radiative heat is variously transferred into sensible heat (related to temperatures), latent energy (related to changes in phase of water), potential energy (related to gravity and height), and kinetic energy (related to movement), and the richness of the phenomena and transformations among these various forms of energy are what makes this problem both challenging and interesting scientifically. It is not (yet) possible to measure EEI directly, although changes measured from satellites are believed to be reliable, albeit biased. The only practical way to estimate net EEI is through an inventory of the changes in energy.","The Earth is warming due to human activities, primarily from increases in greenhouse gases, which create an energy imbalance and result in heating of the planet.",question,2051,161.0
15557,what are the short-term and long-term effects of unethical pro-organisational behavior?,Is behaving unethically for organizations a mixed blessing? A dual-pathway model for the work-to-family spillover effects of unethical pro-organizational behavior,"This research examines the mixed work-to-family spillover effects of unethical pro-organizational behavior. Drawing on conservation of resources theory and the work–home resources model, we develop a dual-pathway model to explain such effects. Based on a three-wave field study involving 214 respondents in China, we find engagement in unethical pro-organizational behavior to be positively associated with employees’ organization-based self-esteem and stress at work, which in turn, leads to work-to-family positive spillover and work-to-family conflict, respectively. We also find that performing tensions moderate the mixed effects of unethical pro-organizational behavior on organization-based self-esteem and work stress and the indirect effects of unethical pro-organizational behavior on work-to-family positive spillover and work-to-family conflict. Our findings have theoretical implications for business ethics scholars and practical implications for managers.","Unethical pro-organizational behavior is associated with increased organization-based self-esteem and work stress, leading to both positive work-to-family spillover and work-to-family conflict.",question,970,193.0
23725,how does spacecraft guidance differ depending on the mission ?,Mathematical modeling of spacecraft guidance and control system in 3D space orbit transfer mission,"Spacecraft performance in an orbital maneuver relies on guidance and control systems which manage the thrust direction within orbit transfer. In this article, the guidance and control approach for spacecraft having a 3D orbit transfer mission is proposed. To derive the optimal variation of steering angles with initial and terminal constraints on the space orbits, a mathematics polynomial function of the guidance command with unknown coefficients is introduced, one of which is determined to achieve the transfer accuracy requirement between space orbits. Genetic Algorithm is employed in finding optimal variation of guidance command and the optimal initial states within the transfer. The attitude control system is also modeled to evaluate the spacecraft response with respect to generated commands by the guidance system. Gas thrusters are considered as attitude actuators for space mission and linear controller with pulse-width pulse-frequency modulator and unconstrained control allocation is employed for controlling steering angles. Results indicate that the presented approach for guidance and control system fairly satisfies the mission requirement.","Spacecraft guidance and control systems manage thrust direction within orbit transfer, with optimal steering angles and initial states determined using a mathematical polynomial function and Genetic Algorithm.",question,1163,209.0

1370,is glutamin good for your gut?,Glutamine analogues as adjunctive therapy for infectious diarrhea,"Glutamine is the major fuel for the gut as well as for many cells in the immune system that becomes conditionally essential during catabolic states. Glutamine supplementation improves intestinal mucosal repair and function. Glutamine, even at high doses, is without side effects and is well tolerated. Though unstable in solution, this is overcome by creating stable dipeptides such as alanyl-glutamine. In HIVpositive patients with wasting, glutamine enhances intestinal absorptive function and weight gain. Glutamine enhances sodium and water absorption in a rabbit model of cholera and Cryptosporidium-infected piglet intestine. Both glutamine and alanyl-glutamine have recently proven effective in a bovine model of Cryptosporidium as well. Finally, a rat model of cholera toxin-induced diarrhea also showed that alanyl-glutamine enhanced water and electrolyte intestinal absorption even better than the traditional glucose solutions. Clearly glutamine and its stabler derivatives hold promise for enhancing repair of mucosal injury by a wide range of infections or toxic agents, and hence have great potential as a new oral rehydration and nutrition therapy for patients with enteric infection, malnutrition, or chemotherapy- or radiationinduced enteritis.","Glutamine supplementation improves intestinal mucosal repair and function, making it beneficial for gut health.",question,1261,111.0
16812,what benefits will 6g offer?,Energy Efficient Device to Device Data Transmission Based on Deep Artificial Learning in 6G Networks,"– The rising wireless service constraints and user compactness have to lead the progress of 6G communication in the modern days. The benefit of 6G over the presented technologies is a huge support for mixed applications and mobility maintenance. Device to Device (D2D) data transmission in 6G has great attention since it gives a better data delivery rate (DDR). Recently, several methods were established for D2D data transmission. However, energy consumption was not considered to improve the network throughput. To handle such problems, an artificial intelligence technique called Deep Neural Regressive Tangent Transfer Classifier (DNRTTC) model is introduced in this research for D2D data transmission in a 6G system. The designed method includes several layers to attain energy-efficient D2D data transmission. The primary layer is the input layer and it includes several mobile nodes as input. Nodes are transmitted to the hidden layer one. For each node, energy, received signal strength, and connection speed of each mobile node is calculated. Then the similarity analysis is done in the following layer where each node is analyzed with its threshold value. The result is sent to the output layer where the better resource mobile nodes are identified by using the activation function. This leads to attaining energy-efficient D2D data transmission in 6G. Results illustrate that the DNRTTC outperformed compared to conventional methods with better energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio, throughput.","6G offers improved energy efficiency, better data delivery rate, and support for mixed applications and mobility maintenance in device-to-device data transmission.",question,1510,163.0

6256,does strip cropping technique helps to reduce soil erosion?,Effects of grass vegetation strips on soil conservation and crop yield under rainfed conditions in the Indian sub‐Himalayas,"Vegetation strips (VS) along with conservation tillage, application of organic amendments and weed mulching improve crop yields by reducing run‐off and topsoil erosion. To investigate these issues, an experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions using grass VS for four and a half years (June 2007 to October 2011) at Dehradun, Uttarakhand, in the Indian Himalayan region. VS were incorporated in the experimental plots (Entisols) in a randomized complete block design in permanent 100 × 20 m (2000 m2) plots with a 2% slope to evaluate the effects of vegetation strips on run‐off, soil loss and crop yield. Three treatments were evaluated: (i) without VS with recommended NPK under conventional tillage, (ii) panicum as VS with recommended NPK under conventional tillage and (iii) palmarosa+ that consists of palmarosa as VS along with organic amendments (farmyard manure, vermicompost and poultry manure) and weed mulch under minimum tillage. The results show that soil loss and run‐off were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in plots under palmarosa+ than without VS treatment. Mean soil loss of 3.4, 5.2 and 7.1 t/ha was recorded from palmarosa+, panicum and without VS treated plots, respectively. Mean run‐off was 234, 356 and 428 mm from plots under palmarosa+, panicum and without VS, respectively. Maize yield was lower on the plots under palmarosa+ compared with panicum, but significantly higher (P < 0.05) than without a strip. The succeeding rainfed wheat yield was significantly greater in plots under palmarosa+ than in the initial years. The wheat yield equivalent was significantly higher in plots under palmarosa+ followed by panicum and without VS. Thus, vegetation strips are recommended for wider adoption to reduce run‐off and soil loss and to increase crop yield. The long‐term goal is to achieve a palmarosa+ system (palmarosa as a vegetation strip along with organic amendments, farmyard manure, vermicompost and poultry manure) and weed mulch under minimum tillage.","Grass vegetation strips reduce soil erosion and runoff, leading to increased crop yields in rainfed conditions.",question,1993,111.0
2329,is e-hrm an effective resource?,Unveiling the Value Creation Process of Electronic Human Resource Management,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) advancement, coupled with an ever-increasing demand for the human resource management (HRM) function to be more efficient, effective, and capable of supporting the strategic goals of every business function, has led to the adoption of electronic human resource management (e-HRM). This study aims to provide both insight and empirical evidence on the success enabler of e-HRM acceptance and e-HRM value creation in the public sector. The study confirms that perceived usefulness (PU) is found to be a strong predictor of e-HRM usage. From an organizational and managerial standpoint, HRM strength has a positive influence on e-HRM usage. In the creation of HRM values, we find e-HRM usage to be a strong predictor of perceived human resource (HR) service quality but not a predictor of the creation of a strategic role for the HRM function. Furthermore, the study indicates that HRM strength is an important direct predictor of the creation of HRM values. Hence, this relationship suggests the importance of policy clarity and consistency. To ensure that e-HRM is used in a more strategic way, the core business functions of an organization, HRM strategy and IT management, should be clearly aligned and integrated.

15390,does intracellular ph affacted by glucose levels,The stimulus-secretion coupling of glucose-induced insulin release. XLII. Effects of extracellular pH on insulin release: their dependency on nutrient concentration.,"Changes in extracellular pH affected insulin output from pancreatic islets stimulated with either glucose or alpha-ketoisocaproate. The extracellular pH at which the highest secretory response occurred was not identical in all cases, being shifted to alkaline values as the concentration of the nutrient secretagogue was increased. The output of insulin correlated with the nutrient-induced increment in 45Ca net uptake, but not with the rate of nutrient oxidation. By reference to changes in intracellular pH observed in islets exposed to either acidic media or increasing concentrations of alpha-ketoisocaproate, and taking into account a titration curve for the buffering capacity of islet homogenates, the optimal intracellular pH for insulin release was found to approximate a value of 0.09 pH unit below basal pH. It is postulated that, in the process of nutrient-induced insulin release, modest changes in intracellular pH participate in the multifactorial coupling between metabolic, ionic and secretory events.","Insulin release is affected by changes in extracellular pH, which correlates with nutrient-induced increments in 45Ca net uptake, but not with the rate of nutrient oxidation.",question,1019,174.0
1272,factors that can be used to monitor landslide formation,Physically based and distributed rainfall intensity and duration thresholds for shallow landslides,"For landslide assessment in a specific small area of interest, regional thresholds may not be applicable and the application of empirical-statistical methodologies could be limited due to a lack of required databases (landslide inventories and triggering rainfall events). Rainfall thresholds for landslides have been recently derived from the implementation of physically based methodologies that usually provide a power-law equation for the study area (e.g. region or a specific basin). In this work, a new methodology for defining rainfall intensity and duration thresholds using a physically based model (TRIGRS) is presented and implemented in a tropical mountain basin of the Colombian Andes. Multiple calculations of the factor of safety for different (synthetic) rainfall events permitted the fitting of power-law equations to the sets of critical intensity and duration conditions, causing failure in each grid cell. Maps of the equation parameters (scale and shape) and the range of applicability (initial and final duration) of the grid cell thresholds were analysed. The results show that the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the soil affected the threshold curve characteristics, comparing sandy soil with silty loam; the higher strength characteristics of sandy soil meant that most extreme rainfall conditions are required to reach their thresholds. This methodology could improve landslide early warning systems in terms of analysing the specific (local) areas that are highly susceptible to landslide occurrence.",This methodology using a physically based model (TRIGRS) can improve landslide early warning systems by analyzing specific local areas susceptible to landslide occurrence.,phrase,1535,171.0

Therefore, the aim of this research was to examine the relationship between mobile phone use and mental health by measuring the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students in Serbia and Italy. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at two distinguished universities in Serbia and Italy from March to May of the 2015/2016 academic year and included 785 students of both genders. The questionnaire was compiled and developed from different published sources regarding the manner and intensity of mobile phone use, along with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) for measuring psychological health. The statistical analysis of the data included the application of binary logistic regression and correlation tests. Results: Statistical analysis indicates that anxiety symptoms are somewhat more present in younger students (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76–0.96), in those who send more text messages (SMSs) (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.11–1.31), and in those who browse the internet less frequently (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73–0.95).

However, we show here that T-bet expression by Th cells is not required for the manifestation of T-cell-induced colitis in the presence of segmented filamentous bacteria and Helicobacter hepaticus. T-bet expression by Th cells controls their survival and localization, their repertoire of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression, the accumulation of monocytes and macrophages in the inflamed colon, and their differentiation to the M1 type, i.e., type 1 inflammation. Nevertheless, T-bet-deficient Th cells efficiently induce colitis, as reflected by weight loss, diarrhea, and colon histopathology. T-bet-deficient Th cells differentiate into Th1/17 cells, able to express IFN-γ and IL-17A upon restimulation.

The analysis identifies two major channels through which the exchange rate affects output. The first is the direct effect which operates on output through its impact on international price competitiveness. The second channel, the indirect one, relies on the close association between disinflation and growth in these countries. That is, to the extent that the exchange rate policy has contributed to lower inflation in these countries it has indirectly caused higher economic growth. The experience of these economies as well as the results of a preliminary empirical analysis strongly suggest that both channels are very important to output growth. In addition, the analysis indicates that a fixed exchange rate regime during the transition process may serve the growth objective better since, to the extent that it is more effective in reducing inflation, it exerts a positive influence on output growth through the direct channel as well.","Exchange rate policy contributes to output growth in transition economies through its impact on international price competitiveness and by lowering inflation, which indirectly leads to higher economic growth.",phrase,1080,208.0

We undertook a meta-analysis of studies examining single measures of morning cortisol (before 10 a.m.) levels in SZ or BD, compared to controls, and to each other; we also sought to examine likely moderators of any observed effects by clinical and demographic variables. Included studies were obtained via systematic searches conducted using Medline, BIOSIS Previews and Embase databases, as well as hand searching. The decision to include or exclude studies, data extraction and quality assessment was completed in duplicate by LG, SM and AS. The initial search revealed 1459 records. Subsequently, 914 were excluded on reading the abstract because they did not meet one or more of the inclusion criteria; of the remaining 545 studies screened in full, included studies were 44 comparing SZ with controls, 19 comparing BD with controls, and 7 studies directly comparing schizophrenia with bipolar disorder. Meta-analysis of SZ (N=2613, g=0.387, p=0.001) and BD (N=704, g=0.269, p=0.004) revealed moderate quality evidence of increased morning cortisol levels in each group compared to controls, but no difference between the two disorders (N=392, g=0.038, p=0.738). Subgroup analyses revealed greater effect sizes for schizophrenia samples with an established diagnosis (as opposed to 'first-episode'), those that were free of medication, and those sampled in an inpatient setting (perhaps reflecting an acute illness phase). In BD, greater morning cortisol levels were found in outpatient and non-manic participants (as opposed to those in a manic state), relative to controls. Neither age nor sex affected cortisol levels in any group. However, earlier greater increases in SZ morning cortisol were evident in samples taken before 8 a.m. (relative to those taken after 8 a.m.). Multiple meta-regression showed that medication status was significantly associated with morning cortisol levels in SZ, when the effects of assay method, sampling time and illness stage were held constant.

Acute concussion and post-concussion syndrome (PCS) can result in autonomic dysfunction in heart rate variability (HRV), but less information is available on blood pressure variability (BPV). Furthermore, the effects of phytocannabinoids on HRV and BPV in PCS are unknown. The purpose of this study was to observe the influence of daily administration of CBD or a combination of CBD and THC on HRV and BPV parameters in 4 female PCS participants. Participants completed a seated 5-minute rest followed by 6 breaths per minute paced breathing protocol. Data was collected prior to phytocannabinoid intake and continued over 54 to 70 days. High frequency systolic BPV parameter increased every assessment period, unless altered due to external circumstances and symptoms. HRV parameters showed less consistent and varying responses.

2728,the performance of failure on tunnel,Reliability analysis of tunnel lining considering soil spatial variability,"Abstract Reliability analysis of the support lining of a shallow circular tunnel excavated in spatially varying soils is presented in the paper. The soil-structure interaction is considered by using a numerical model named the hyperstatic reaction method (HRM). It can provide the internal forces of the tunnel lining in terms of bending moments ( M ), axial ( N ) and shear forces ( V ). The sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) in combination with the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is employed to perform the reliability analysis. This method allows reducing the number of the involved input variables according to their sensitivity indices obtained by GSA, and constructing a rational meta-model with limited calls to the mechanical model. Multiple failure modes in the ultimate limit state (ULS) analysis are considered in this study. The individual and system failure probabilities are all provided. The obtained results show that the exceedance of the bending moment resistance is the most probable failure mode, and that the soil spatial variability has a significant influence on the tunnel lining reliability. In addition, the contribution of different soil properties to the variance of the lining forces and the influence of the autocorrelation length on the lining reliability are discussed.","The most probable failure mode for tunnel lining is the exceedance of bending moment resistance, and soil spatial variability significantly influences tunnel lining reliability.",phrase,1311,177.0

The relationships were tested via structural equation modelling using data collected from a sample of program analysts from IT sector with special reference to TIDEL Park, Coimbatore. The findings indicate that all the identified influencers namely core-self evaluations, pro-active personality and leader-member exchange have emerged as significant influencers of work engagement (R2 = 0.69). Furthermore, work engagement had a significant impact on task performance (R2 = 0.50). Special focus and initiatives have to be harnessed on having good leader member-exchange and recruiting employees who are proactive and who have core-self evaluations as they have shown significant impact on work engagement and hence task performance.

23959,does internal rhythm affect decision-making?,"The cell cycle related rhythms, cells' states correlation and the cancer","We consider the decision making by mammalian cells, looking them as dynamic systems with rhythms. We calculate the effective dimension of the cell division model of the healthy mammalian cells consistent with the data: it is described via a four dimensional dynamic system. 
We assume that the cell's decision making property is strongly affected by the cells rhythms, their causal relations, and by the correlation between internal states of different cells in tissue. There is a strong correlation between the states of different healthy cells (verified partially experimentally), and we assume that there is no such a correlation between internal states of the healthy and cancer cells. The origins of the cancer are just the disruption of this correlation (self-identification of the cells) and the change of the causal relations between the Circadian and cell cycle rhythms. Assuming the Gaussian channel version of the cell-cell communications and a key role of public goods for the cancer cells, we get a strong correlation between the states of different cancer cells.","Cell decision-making is strongly affected by cell rhythms, their causal relations, and the correlation between internal states of different cells in tissue.",question,1076,156.0
1904,what are montessori teaching methods in early childhood?,Włoskie koncepcje wychowania i edukacji dziecka w wieku przedszkolnym. Metoda Marii Montessori i podejście Reggio Emilia,"The paper presents two Italian approaches to early childhood education: the Montessori method and the Reggio Emilia approach. Although they emerged in different historical periods and socio-political realities, these two approaches have a lot in common with regard to values like love and respect for children and their developmental rights. Moreover, they share a belief in the potential and boundless resources of the child as well as shifting the emphasis from a teacher’s activity to that of the child. In comparison to the Montessori method, the Reggio Emilia approach strongly highlights the importance of relations and interactions in the children’s learning process. Group work, which has been one of the fundamentals of the Reggio Emilia approach from the very beginning, is the main difference between these two approaches. The article presents the background of each pedagogical idea (the Montessori method – the beginning of 20 th century, Reggio Emilia – the 1950s). The description of the ideas is based on such aspects as the image of a child, the image of a teacher and the role of environment in education. In the article, the authors refer mainly to the thoughts of Montessori, the creator of her own method, and Loris Malaguzzi, who was the leader of the educational experience in Reggio Emilia.","Montessori teaching methods emphasize the child's potential, boundless resources, and shift the focus from teacher's activity to the child's activity in early childhood education.",question,1314,179.0

6138,what are the effects of financial problem on students?,Student Loan Debt and Financial Stress: Implications for Academic Performance,"With the costs of college on the rise across the United States, many postsecondary educators are concerned about the potential effect of financial strain on student outcomes. Scholars have long hypothesized that students who are concerned about finances may demonstrate lower goal commitment, academic engagement, and persistence (Boatman & Long, 2016; Cabrera, Nora, & Castañeda, 1992; Nora, Barlow, & Crisp, 2006). High levels of student loan debt and financial stress have been associated with increases in students’ likelihood of dropping out, stopping out, or reducing their course loads (Dwyer, Hodson, & McCloud, 2013; Joo, Durband, & Grable, 2008; Robb, Moody, & Abdel-Ghany, 2012). Financial concerns have also been linked with extended time to degree (Letkiewicz et al., 2014), which can further escalate the costs of college. The causal mechanisms linking financial concerns to college outcomes are not fully understood. Researchers have suggested that financial strain may reduce students’ motivation to complete college (Cabrera et al., 1992; Nora et al., 2006) or deplete the cognitive resources students have available to allocate to academic concerns (Northern, O’Brien, & Goetz, 2010), yet few studies have specifically examined the associations between financial concerns and academic performance. Furthermore, researchers have not yet distinguished the effects of high levels of financial stress from more moderate levels of financial stress. These questions have significant implications for student affairs practitioners, who are tasked with ensuring that financial concerns do not negatively affect students’ academic success. Trends in student borrowing and financial stress vary between racial and ethnic groups and by gender, pointing to possible inequities in financial support for college. One study shows that Black bachelor’s degree recipients were more likely to have borrowed $30,000 or more in student loans, potentially reflecting lower access to other forms of financial support (Baum & Steele, 2010). Conversely, Latinx and Asian students may be more averse to taking out student loans, even when other sources of financial aid do not cover college costs (Goldrick-Rab & Kelchen, 2015). Some studies have shown that self-reported financial stress is higher among Students of Color, though this may be accounted for by the inadequacy of available financial resources (Archuleta, Dale, & Spann, 2013; Grable & Joo, 2006). Researchers have found that women report higher levels of financial stress than do men (Archuleta et al., 2013; Heckman, Lim, & Montalto, 2014) but that the amount of student debt associated with an increased risk of dropping out is lower for men than for women (Dwyer et al., 2013). Financial concerns include both objective factors, reflecting the actual availability and use of resources, and subjective factors, reflecting students’ perceptions of their financial stability (Nora et al., 2006).

AI and big data, cloud computing, and blockchain provide technical support for transforming and upgrading the financial industry. Big data provides essential resources, cloud computing as infrastructure, and blockchain establishes a fundamental mechanism. New intelligent finance uses AI as the main driving force to empower all participants and business links in the financial industry, playing the critical role of AI technology in product innovation, process reengineering, and service upgrade in the financial industry. This chapter analyzes the development of different application scenarios in the new environment (intelligent risk management, intelligent payment, intelligent customer service, intelligent marketing, intelligent investment research, Robo-Advisor, intelligent claims, and intelligent treasury management). From the perspective of each scenario’s development level, intelligent risk management is relatively mature, intelligent payment is developing rapidly, and intelligent marketing and customer service have broad development space in the future.

4684,do lifestyle changes affect in people's anxiety?,The Association between Lifestyle Changes and Psychological Distress during COVID-19 Lockdown: The Moderating Role of COVID-Related Stressors,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying circumstances (lockdown and social distancing) have been found to cause lifestyle habit changes. While negative changes (adopting risky behaviors) are known to be associated with high psychological distress, the effect of positive changes (adopting health-enhancing behaviors) has yet to be investigated. This study examined the association between the nature of changes and psychological distress, in addition to the moderating effect of “COVID-related stressors”. Online questionnaires, completed by 1969 participants, assessed the following: lifestyle changes due to COVID-19 with regard to cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep quality, and eating habits; COVID-related stressors; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Positive and negative changes were associated with higher psychological distress compared to no lifestyle change, and there was a moderating effect of COVID-related stressors in the association between COVID-related lifestyle changes and distress. In conclusion, to reduce psychological distress in overwhelming circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people should carefully consider whether to make changes in their lifestyle habits before doing so, even if these changes are perceived as positive and health-enhancing.

9249,does exercise improve cognition?,Exercise Training and Functional Connectivity Changes in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Healthy Elders.,"BACKGROUND
Effective interventions are needed to improve brain function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus is a hub of the default mode network (DMN) and is preferentially vulnerable to disruption of functional connectivity in MCI and AD.


OBJECTIVE
We investigated whether 12 weeks of aerobic exercise could enhance functional connectivity of the PCC/precuneus in MCI and healthy elders.


METHODS
Sixteen MCI and 16 healthy elders (age range = 60-88) engaged in a supervised 12-week walking exercise intervention. Functional MRI was acquired at rest; the PCC/precuneus was used as a seed for correlated brain activity maps.


RESULTS
A linear mixed effects model revealed a significant interaction in the right parietal lobe: the MCI group showed increased connectivity while the healthy elders showed decreased connectivity. In addition, both groups showed increased connectivity with the left postcentral gyrus. Comparing pre to post intervention changes within each group, the MCI group showed increased connectivity in 10 regions spanning frontal, parietal, temporal and insular lobes, and the cerebellum. Healthy elders did not demonstrate any significant connectivity changes.


CONCLUSION
The observed results show increased functional connectivity of the PCC/precuneus in individuals with MCI after 12 weeks of moderate intensity walking exercise training. The protective effects of exercise training on cognition may be realized through the enhancement of neural recruitment mechanisms, which may possibly increase cognitive reserve. Whether these effects of exercise training may delay further cognitive decline in patients diagnosed with MCI remains to be demonstrated.","Aerobic exercise, like a 12-week walking intervention, can increase functional connectivity of the PCC/precuneus in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.",question,1775,159.0

Standard economic models suggest that prohibitions can have substantial undesirable consequences and that they may fail to accomplish their primary objective: reduced consumption of the prohibited commodity. Economic reasoning also suggests that moderate sin taxes on the commodity in question, possibly combined with various types of regulation, are likely to reduce consumption more effectively than prohibition while avoiding many of the negative consequences of prohibitions. Evidence from the U.S. experience with the prohibition of alcohol, 1920–33, is consistent with the predictions of the economic analysis of prohibition: neither alcohol consumption nor alcohol prices changed substantially, while violent crime increased.","Prohibition may not effectively reduce consumption and can have undesirable consequences, while moderate sin taxes and regulations could be more effective in reducing consumption.",question,923,179.0
6946,how reliable are patient-reported outcomes?,Randomized Controlled Trials 3: Measurement and Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes.,"The study of patient-reported outcomes, now common in clinical research, had its origins in social and scientific developments during the latter twentieth century. Patient-reported outcomes comprise functional and health status, health-related quality of life, and quality of life. The terms overlap and are used inconsistently, and these terms should be distinguished from expressions of preference regarding health states. Regulatory standards from the USA and European Union provide some guidance regarding reporting of patient-reported outcomes. Determining that patient-reported outcomes measurement is important depends in part on the balance between subjective and objective outcomes of the health problem under study. Instrument selection depends to a large extent on practical considerations. A number of instruments can be identified that are frequently used in particular clinical situations. The domain coverage of commonly used generic short forms varies substantially. Individualized measurement of quality of life is possible, but resource intensive. Focus groups are useful, not only for scale development but also to confirm the appropriateness of existing instruments.Under classical test theory, validity and reliability are the critical characteristics of tests. Under item response theory, validity remains central, but the focus moves from the reliability of scales to the relative levels of traits in individuals and items' relative difficulty. Plans for clinical studies should include an explicit model of the relationship of patient-reported outcomes to other parameters, as well as define the magnitude of difference in patient-reported outcomes that will be considered important. It is particularly important to minimize missing patient-reported outcome data; to a limited extent, a variety of statistical techniques can mitigate the consequences of missing data.","Patient-reported outcomes' reliability depends on the balance between subjective and objective outcomes, instrument selection, and validity.",question,1891,140.0

The study applies the cost basis framework, earlier used for instance by Chan et al. (2001) and Chambers et al. (2001) to estimate the proportion of R&D costs of the firm that represents the investments in R&D capital. The study investigates how different firm-specific characteristics like R&D intensity, profitability, sales growth, size and risk are associated with the ratio of the economic R&D asset to the difference between the market and book value of equity, i.e. the R&D capital ratio. This study extends the current literature by investigating the proportion of R&D costs that represents investment in R&D capital in different countries and industries. The results give evidence that the estimated proportion of the R&D expenses that represents investments in R&D capital is large in all countries and industries. The results also indicate that the ratio of the economic R&D asset to the difference between the market and book value of equity can be explained by different firm-specific characteristics, especially profitability and growth. This study gives international and industry-specific evidence that the R&D capital ratio makes economic sense and thus contributes to the literature that investigates the economic relevance of the R&D capital, especially Ballester et al.

We compared Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in preschool children with DS with a reference group, and investigated child-related factors (i.e., developmental quotient, adaptive function, health problems, problem behaviour), and maternal level of education on HRQoL. Method : In a cohort of 55 children with DS, HRQoL was measured with the TNO-AZL preschool children Quality of Life Questionnaire (TAPQoL). Data from a reference group were used for comparison. Developmental Quotient (DQ) was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, adaptive function with the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, health problems were derived from the medical file, and behavioural problems were measured with the Child Behaviour Checklist. Results : Children with DS (N=55; mean age 41.7 months) scored significantly lower on the TAPQoL domains lung and stomach problems, motor function and communication compared to the reference group. DQ had a significant negative correlation with the domains lung problems and liveliness. Children with DS with respiratory or gastro-intestinal problems showed significant lower scores on lung problems and communication. Problem behavior had a significant negative correlation with the domains sleeping, appetite and social function. A low level of maternal education correlated negatively with positive mood. Adaptive function and congenital heart defect (CHD) did not significantly correlate with HRQoL.

3292,how muscle build by leucine?,"Leucine supplementation of a low-protein mixed macronutrient beverage enhances myofibrillar protein synthesis in young men: a double-blind, randomized trial.","BACKGROUND
Leucine is a key amino acid involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis.


OBJECTIVE
We assessed the effect of the supplementation of a lower-protein mixed macronutrient beverage with varying doses of leucine or a mixture of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) on myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) at rest and after exercise.


DESIGN
In a parallel group design, 40 men (21 ± 1 y) completed unilateral knee-extensor resistance exercise before the ingestion of 25 g whey protein (W25) (3.0 g leucine), 6.25 g whey protein (W6) (0.75g leucine), 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 3.0 g total leucine (W6+Low-Leu), 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 5.0 g total leucine (W6+High-Leu), or 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine, isoleucine, and valine to 5.0 g total leucine. A primed continuous infusion of l-[ring-(13)C6] phenylalanine with serial muscle biopsies was used to measure MPS under baseline fasted and postprandial conditions in both a rested (response to feeding) and exercised (response to combined feeding and resistance exercise) leg.


RESULTS
The area under the blood leucine curve was greatest for the W6+High-Leu group compared with the W6 and W6+Low-Leu groups (P < 0.001). In the postprandial period, rates of MPS were increased above baseline over 0-1.5 h in all treatments. Over 1.5-4.5 h, MPS remained increased above baseline after all treatments but was greatest after W25 (∼267%) and W6+High-Leu (∼220%) treatments (P = 0.002).


CONCLUSIONS
A low-protein (6.25 g) mixed macronutrient beverage can be as effective as a high-protein dose (25 g) at stimulating increased MPS rates when supplemented with a high (5.0 g total leucine) amount of leucine. These results have important implications for formulations of protein beverages designed to enhance muscle anabolism.

5267,the risk factors for aki in children?,Relationship Between Acute Kidney Injury and Fluid Overload: Are We Any Closer to the Truth?,"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine www.pccmjournal.org 1097 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a recognized risk factor for poor outcomes in critically ill children (1, 2). In most instances AKI does not occur in isolation. The kidneys are endowed with luxury perfusion in relationship to its metabolic needs, and hence other vital organs are more readily insulted in the context of a systemic insult. Thus in the absence of a targeted insult, in most critically ill children, AKI occurs in association with multiple organ failure (3). Moreover, the mechanism of renal dysfunction and the relationship of structural changes to functional changes in critically ill children are unclear as evidenced by the inconsistent microstructural changes ranging from normal to severe glomerular and tubular damage seen on post mortem or renal biopsy studies of patients with AKI (4, 5). These considerations are important because they underline the fact that AKI cannot be considered in isolation but as one of several target organs that may contribute to a poor outcome. It is in this context that the article by Hames et al (6) published in this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine should be evaluated. Hames et al (6) investigated risk factors for mortality in 98 critically ill children with AKI. Patients excluded were the following: children post cardiotomy, those with chronic kidney failure, those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for an indication other than AKI or fluid overload, and those with incomplete documentation. The primary outcome was death before hospital discharge. The retrospective nature of the study precludes any conclusion about causation. However, there are other limitations including selection bias of only studying children receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT), the variable technique of RRT (an almost equal mix of intermittent hemodialysis and CRRT), and the inclusion of patients receiving Extra Corporeal Life Support, as the etiology of AKI in these patients is even more complex (7). The mortality rate is expectedly high in this high risk population (26–47%) but is unlikely to be due to single organ failure in contemporary critical care units. These risk factors simply confirm what has already been identified in other studies (3.8). To advance our understanding and therapies, what is required is categorization of these cases into more useful subtypes or phenotypes against which specific strategies of prevention or treatment might be directed. An explanation of cause of death is important because it is unlikely due only to AKI and fluid overload. Important considerations to shed light on causation are explanations of contribution of causative factors leading to AKI as well as other vital organ insults. Is the fluid overload a contributor to poor outcomes or an indicator of severely insulted tissues (9)? How does earlier initiation of renal replacement prevent AKI? Recent adult studies have attempted to answer the question of timing initiation of CRRT without consensus (10–12). Can a common mechanism for the development of AKI be postulated from the diverse range of underlying conditions (stem cell transplant, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, medical cardiac disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) reported in this study population? How can we differentiate a functional AKI from a structural AKI? How can we identify which patients have structural changes that are reversible? The questions posed need to be answered to fully understand any relationship between AKI, fluid overload, and poor outcomes. Recovery from experimental acute ischemia generated by renal artery clamping suggests a significant degree of resilience from systemic circulatory aberrations (13). However, the microcirculation might be a leading culprit to the functional and possibly structural changes in the kidney as well as multiple organ damage in more severe and prolonged systemic insults. Whether via disturbances in oxygen delivery, endothelial dysfunction, and glycocalyx damage or perhaps amplification of an already dysfunctional inflammatory system, altered microcirculation likely plays a central role (14). Fluid balance alone is unlikely to contribute from a mechanistic perspective. The role of biomarkers remains elusive but holds promise. Kellum et al (15) describes the validation of two novel urinary biomarkers exploring the mechanisms of functional and structural changes in AKI. A recent adult study was able to identify two distinct phenotypes of AKI in adult patients with ARDS and AKI using a battery of endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers (16). Identifying the different phenotypes hold promise for early warnings of functional and structural changes in the kidney, but therapies that we can apply to support renal recovery still eludes us. *See also p. 1069.",Fluid overload is a recognized risk factor for poor outcomes in critically ill children with acute kidney injury (AKI).,phrase,4890,119.0

In his book, Creating Great Schools: Six Systems at the Heart of Educational Innovation, Schlechty writes, &dquo;educators must learn that their business is to design tasks and activities with attributes that encourage students to invest their most precious resources, that is their time, energy and attention. Learning in schools happens when schools do their business&dquo; (p. 8). The author’s premise (see p. xv) is that today’s schools are organized to gain compliance and ensure attendance. And should America demand or expect more from its system of public education, educators &dquo;must dramatically change the systems that define behavior in schools.&dquo; The six school systems the author describes are recruitment and induction, knowledge transmission, power and authority, evaluation systems, directional systems, and boundary systems. Schlechty argues that when leaders change or alter these systems, known as the normative order, they typically encounter great resistance because the very essence of organizational meaning is found within these systems. Schlechty asserts that for schools to truly meet higher expectations, the public must revisit the original aims of public schooling in America: attendance and compliance. According to Schlechty, educators have achieved both aims admirably, but he argues that our present system has not and will","America's education system focuses on gaining compliance and ensuring attendance, with six critical systems: recruitment and induction, knowledge transmission, power and authority, evaluation systems, directional systems, and boundary systems.",question,1741,243.0
6785,is racism associated with cognitive biases,Cognitive Biases in Chronic Illness and Their Impact on Patients' Commitment,"Cognitive biases are constructs based on erroneous or deformed perceptions which produce systematically distorted representations with respect to some aspects of the objective reality, such as prejudices (Haselton et al., 2005). Biases impact everyday life because they affect decisions and behaviors. For example, one may persist in an unhealthy behavior (e.g., smoking) because he selectively overestimates evidence that feeds up a pre-existing conviction (e.g., “smoking boosts my concentration”) (Masiero et al., 2019): this is known as confirmation bias (Hernandez and Preston, 2013). While some biases appear inherent to human cognition, others are situation–specific. Several studies have shown that there are cognitive biases typical of people who live with a chronic illness and continually attend to health management (Lichtenthal et al., 2017). These biases influence information processing about the disease and consequently decision making (DM), impacting the health and quality of life (Khatibi et al., 2014). The objectives of the present contribution are to synthetize information on biases in chronic illness and to highlight the possible effect of biases on health management. The last sections will explore how biases could influence not only the information processing, but also the motivation and agency within the patients’ healthcare journey.","Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, impact everyday decisions and behaviors.",question,1365,85.0
18305,what are the benefits of c60 for humans?,"Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of Liposoluble C60 at the Cellular, Molecular, and Whole-Animal Levels","Introduction Liposoluble carbon-60 (C60) has potential applications in many fields, including cosmetics, medical devices, and medicine, but its specific mechanism of action remains unclear. This study explored whether liposoluble C60 could be delivered to human organs, tissues, and cells through blood, extracellular fluid, and cell culture fluid and whether it exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects at the molecular, cellular, and whole-animal levels. Methods At the cellular level, we mixed C60 dissolved in grape seed oil with cell culture medium containing 10% serum and investigated its effects on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) release, migration, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and apoptosis in freshly isolated human neutrophils. At the molecular level, we mixed a trace amount of C60 dissolved in grape seed oil with aqueous and ethanolic solutions and studied its antioxidant effect. At the animal level, we investigated the inhibitory effect of C60 on the serum inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) in beagle dogs after oral administration of C60 dissolved in grape seed oil. Results The results showed that the trace amount of C60 dissolved in grape seed oil significantly inhibited TNF-α release, cell migration, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst in freshly isolated human neutrophils. In addition, the trace amount of C60 dissolved in grape seed oil had a significant scavenging effect on superoxide free radicals and 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine free radicals. Oral administration of C60 dissolved in grape seed oil markedly reduced the level of the serum inflammatory marker CRP in beagle dogs. Conclusion In summary, a trace amount of hydrophobic C60 in hydrophilic media effectively produced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in cells and animals. C60 dissolved in grape seed oil is a novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug candidate.","Liposoluble C60 has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in cells and animals, potentially making it a novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug candidate.",question,1901,163.0

16253,Do Cell Phones Cause Brain Cancer?,Does the use of cell phones cause brain tumors?,"Myth: Cell phones and other similar technology increase the risk of brain tumors. Answer: Lawsuits and news headlines have fueled the myth that cell phones cause cancer, particularly brain cancer. According to a survey by Gansler (2008), about 30% of Americans believe the myth. Cell phones are clearly visible in society. Statistics show that 79% of the U.S. population and 90% of European and Asian teens own a cell phone (Infoplease, 2008; Jannsens, 2005). Cell phones are convenient and can be used at almost any location. New technology such as cameras, computer data storage with downloads, and wake-up calling have led to increased use (Janssens). A cell phones works like a radio, with both the portable phone and the ground antennae emitting nonionizing electromagnetic radiation in radiofrequency zone from 824–924 megahertz (MHz). Digital phones use frequencies up to 1,900 MHz. In comparison, the average household microwave uses 450 MHz of electromagnetic radiation ( Jannsens, 2005). The primary concern of cell phone use has been the risk of cancer to exposed tissues close to the phone. Meninges, brain, parotid gland, and acoustic nerves all are exposed to nonionizing electromagnetic radiation (Auvinen, Tovio, & Tokola, 2006; Hardell et al., 2002). Jannsens (2005) questioned whether radiowaves or electromagnetic radiation in general cause biologic responses with detrimental effects on normal health. The evidence is complex and has to consider the biologic target as well as the length of the wave, spectrum absorption rate, and density. The human body can tolerate an electromagnetic field up to 5 milliigauss. An electromagnetic field greater than 5 milliigauss can damage the body and cell constituents; ionizing gamma irradiation destroys DNA and large molecules. Electromagnetic fields are invisible lines of force that surround any electrical device, including power lines (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 2008). House (1999) contended that the increased use of cell phones has resulted in the installation of numerous radio transmitters to relay calls, therefore giving weight to concerns about radiofrequency radiation emissions. Klaeboe, Blaasaas, and Tynes (2007) stated that radiofrequency does not have enough energy to break chemical bonds or damage DNA. For nonionizing radiation in lower frequencies, the health effect appears to be different. Living cells phenotypically adapt to environmental stimuli by metabolic alterations, including the induction of oxidates, stress, and heat shock (Jannsens, 2005). Based on a study of mice exposed to radiofrequency irradiation, the calcium signal transmissions to the inner cell space were modified with exposure. Exposure was carried out using the antenna of a cell phone working at a frequency of 800 MHz in the center (Anghileri, Mayayo, Domingo, & Thouvenot, 2006).

4293,does preterm birth happen more because of race?,A population-based study of race-specific risk for preterm premature rupture of membranes.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that race is associated with the risk of preterm birth due to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and its recurrence.


STUDY DESIGN
We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Missouri Department of Health's maternally linked birth certificate database (1989-1997) to assess racial effects on the occurrence and recurrence of PPROM, while adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal medical risk factors (n = 644,462).


RESULTS
Black mothers were more likely to have PPROM compared to white mothers (aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.0-2.5). The magnitude of risk of PPROM for black mothers compared to white mothers was greatest at < 28 weeks of gestation (aOR 2.8, 95% CI, 2.5-3.2). Black mothers were at significantly higher risk of recurrent PPROM compared to white mothers (aOR 6.4, 95% CI, 3.7-11.0).

10481,does acupuncture help with pain?,Understandings of acupuncture application and mechanisms.,"Acupuncture involves the stimulation of acupoints, which are located at specific sites of the human body, by insertion of fine metal needles, followed by manipulation. Acupuncture has been proven to be an effective treatment in pain relief. Available evidence showed that acupuncture alleviates acute pain in conditions such as postoperative pain, acute back pain, labour pain, primary dysmenorrhea, tension-type headaches and migraines. In addition, acupuncture relieves chronic pain, for example, low back pain (LBP), knee osteoarthritis (KOA), headache, shoulder pain, and neck pain. For other diseases like insomnia, drug addiction and stroke, more high-quality randomized control trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm the efficacy of acupuncture, although there are particular difficulties surrounding adequate blinding and control group designs. Recent biomedical technology unveils the mechanisms of acupuncture. Studies have found that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels are involved in the stimulation of acupuncture at the acupoint area. In the central nervous system (CNS), neurotransmissions including opioids, serotonin, norepinephrine, orexin and endocannabinoid are modulated by acupuncture to induce analgesia. Moreover, acupuncture reduces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels on the peripheral level by acting on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, mediating peripheral opioid release. Acupuncture helps to treat insomnia by inhibiting sympathetic activity and down-regulating the HPA axis. Additionally, acupuncture reduces the effects of positive and negative reinforcements by modulating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Recently, i-needles have been developed to allow for the analysis of metagenomics, meta-transcriptomics, and host-microbiome relationships following acupuncture, while skin implantable microsensors or needle-shaped microsensors are feasible for monitoring real-time microenvironmental changes in acupoints and even target organs. These studies may further accelerate the understanding of acupuncture's action mechanism.","Acupuncture has been proven effective in pain relief for conditions such as acute and chronic pain, including postoperative pain, back pain, and headaches.",question,2156,155.0
1768,does production of hyaluronic acid decrease with age?,The decreased secretion of hyaluronan by older human fibroblasts under physiological conditions is mainly associated with the down-regulated expression of hyaluronan synthases but not with the expression levels of hyaluronidases,"Although it has been reported that levels of hyaluronan are decreased in the dermis of aged skin, little is known about the cellular mechanism(s) underlying that hyaluronan deficiency. Since hyaluronan is produced by dermal fibroblasts and is secreted into the surrounding dermal tissues, we examined the secretion of hyaluronan by dermal fibroblasts and characterized its cellular mechanism using real-time RT-PCR and western blotting for its synthesizing and degrading enzymes, hyaluronan synthase and hyaluronidase, respectively. The secretion of hyaluronan by dermal fibroblasts derived from differently aged human donors, was higher in the younger human fibroblasts tested (0 and 19 years old) compared to the older human fibroblasts tested (39, 56 and 77 years old). The relative secretion levels of hyaluronan by the different human fibroblasts tested were attributable to the relative expression of hyaluronan synthases 1, 2, 3 but not hyaluronidases 1, 2 enzymes at the gene and protein levels among those fibroblasts. These findings indicate that the deficiency of hyaluronan in the aged dermis might result from the down-regulation in the potential of older human fibroblasts to secrete hyaluronan and that decrease in secretory potential is mainly associated with the down-regulated expression of hyaluronan synthases, especially hyaluronan synthase 2, but not with the expression levels of hyaluronidases.","Yes, hyaluronic acid production decreases with age due to down-regulated expression of hyaluronan synthases in older human fibroblasts.",question,1418,135.0

12071,what is the definition of sustainability in tourism,The role of events in creating sustainable tourism destinations,"Sustainability is one of the key dimensions of development for tourist destinations. One commonly accepted definition of sustainable development is that used in the Brundtland Report – development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). For tourism destinations, maintaining visitor numbers at an economically acceptable level, yet one which neither exceeds the capacity of the local environment, nor the tolerance levels of the local community, can be a difficult task. Events, whether large or small, can play a role in finding the sustainable balance that destinations seek. Events can bring visitors outside the traditional peak seasons and can contribute substantially to local economies. Events can create awareness of a destination and also be the catalyst for repeat visitation by attendees. Finally, events can draw attention to the social and environmental impacts of tourism, contributing to the education of visitors.","Events can help create sustainable tourism by attracting visitors outside peak seasons, contributing to local economies, and raising awareness of social and environmental impacts.",question,1061,179.0

2681,how to balancing class in fraud detection ecommerce using machine learning?,GAN based Data Augmentation to Resolve Class Imbalance,"Online shopping has become a major trend to purchase stuff and credit card is one of the most common pay online. So, it is not surprising to see many potential credit card frauds. In fact, the number of credit card frauds has been growing as technology grows and people can take advantage of it. Therefore, it is very important to implement a robust and effective method to detect such frauds. The machine learning algorithms are appropriate for these tasks since they try to maximize the accuracy of predictions and hence can be relied upon. However, there is an impending flaw where-in machine learning models may not perform well due to the presence of an imbalance across classes distribution within the sample set. So, in many related tasks, the datasets have a very small number of observed fraud cases (sometimes around 1% positive fraud instances found). Therefore, this imbalance presence may impact any learning model’s behavior by predicting all labels as the majority class, hence allowing no scope for generalization in the predictions made by the model. We chose a relevant paper ”Using generative adversarial networks for improving classification effectiveness in credit card fraud detection”[8], as our primary inspiration for training Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to generate a large number of convincing (and reliable) synthetic examples of the minority class that can be used to alleviate the class imbalance within the training set. In this project, we present a similar approach to the paper[8] where we focus on a small subset of the provided dataset to address the class imbalance issue and generate enough synthetic positive samples by training GANs and we compare with the existing vanilla oversampling method for a cohesive comparison.",GAN-based data augmentation can generate synthetic examples of the minority class to alleviate class imbalance in credit card fraud detection.,question,1768,142.0

Their failure seems due to their inability to determine the right time for the activities and to remember all the activity steps. Aim This study assessed a smartphone intervention, which was designed to help eight participants (four presenting with intellectual disability and blindness and four presenting with intellectual disability and hearing impairment) to independently start and carry out daily activities at appropriate times. Method The intervention was introduced according to a non-concurrent multiple baseline design across participants. During the intervention, each participant was provided with a smartphone, which was fitted with the time schedule of his or her activities and the verbal or pictorial instructions for the single steps of those activities. When the time for an activity was reached, the participant was automatically reminded to start that activity and, thereafter, he or she was presented with the instructions for it. Results The use of the smartphone intervention promoted great improvement over the baseline for all participants. That is, the participants managed to (a) independently start the activities at the scheduled times and (b) carry out those activities with high levels of accuracy.

17811,benefits of hydroponic system,Investigation on the Effects of Hydroponic-planting Versus Soil-planting Using Plectranthus amboinicus as a Plant Model,"Hydroponic system is a method of growing crops or plants in a soilless system, by suspending the plant crops in a nutrient-rich solution, with reduced interferences from factors such as soil quality, irrigation and climate. However, there is limited information available on how hydroponic planting will affect the plant’s bioactivities, as well as the associated biochemical, mineral, phytochemical and antioxidant enzyme contents. In this study, we used Plectranthus amboinicus (Indian borage) as a medicinal plant model, to investigate the differences between hydroponic-planted (HP) versus soil-planted (SP) plants. Here, aqueous extracts of Indian borage from HP and SP samples were prepared, followed by testing for their phytochemical, mineral, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. Based on our results, SP sample was detected with higher antioxidant potentials, using two different radical scavenging assays. This observation is correlating to the higher phytochemical contents (total phenolic, flavonoid, and hydroxycinnamic acids contents), as well as higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, detected in the SP sample. However, no significant difference was detected between HP and SP samples, in terms of their protein protection potentials. On the other hand, HP sample was tested with higher mineral contents (iron, copper, magnesium and calcium) using the atomic absorption spectroscopy method. Additionally, higher antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase) were also detected in the HP sample using in vitro biochemical assays. In the future study, more plant models can be included in the comparison between HP and SP effects, to determine if a similar phenomenon is observed. Through similar studies, more related information could be gathered to guide the choice of suitable planting systems with regard to food security, in terms of both harvest yields and nutritional contents.","Hydroponic planting results in higher mineral contents and antioxidative enzymes, while soil planting leads to higher antioxidant potentials and phytochemical contents.",phrase,1914,168.0
7281,do children with neurological soft signs have altered brain structures?,Psychiatric disorders after childhood stroke.,"OBJECTIVES
To determine the rate, types, and correlates of psychiatric disorder (PD) following stroke and orthopedic disorders in children and adolescents.


METHOD
Children aged 5 to 19 were assessed. The study used a cross-sectional design that compared 29 stroke subjects with 29 congenital clubfoot or scoliosis subjects. Assessments of psychiatric status; cognitive, adaptive, academic, and family functioning; family psychiatric history; neuroimaging; and neurological status were conducted. The main outcome measure was a current PD not present before the stroke or orthopedic disorder.


RESULTS
Poststroke PD occurred significantly more often than postorthopedic diagnosis PD (17/29 [59%] versus 4/29 [14%], p < or =.001). Subjects with ongoing poststroke PD had significantly more impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning, higher intensity family psychiatric history scores, and tended toward higher neurological severity index scores, but they were not different regarding lesion volume or family functioning compared with stroke subjects without PD. Regression analyses showed that neurological severity and family psychiatric history independently contributed significantly to predicting PD.


CONCLUSIONS
The data suggest that there are significant biopsychosocial correlates of PD in children with focal neurological lesions. These include a relatively abnormal neurological exam, lower IQ, and increased family psychopathology.","Children with focal neurological lesions have significant biopsychosocial correlates of psychiatric disorders, including a relatively abnormal neurological exam and lower IQ.",question,1449,174.0
23668,effect of decriminalization of drugs,Research snippets,"There is a worldwide debate taking place on the decriminalisation of illicit drugs. The ‘War on Drugs’ is clearly not working so new approaches are being tried legally, socially, economically, politically and ethically to limit the harm of recreational substances. Central to all discussions are the medical effects of illicit drug use (Volkow et al. N Engl J Med 2014;370:2219–27). Some drugs have benefits if used responsibly but many do not: cocaine, crystal methamphetamine and heroin (diamorphine) are widely condemned because of their detrimental medical and psychological effects. Marijuana is becoming a test case. Because it is the most commonly used of all recreational drugs and is perceived as relatively harmless, it has been decriminalised in many countries and has been legalised in places like Uruguay and the states of Colorado and Washington in the USA. Other countries may follow as there are compelling arguments in favour of relaxing the laws concerning marijuana for the following reasons: 1 It is futile trying to prevent the use of a product that is so widely used. 2 The costs of policing and prosecuting do not make economic sense, and taxes can be collected. (Colorado benefited by more than $10 million in the first few months of legislation.) 3 The politics of championing populist causes should not be underestimated. 4 Open markets will lower prices and hence reduce crime and black marketeering.

22488,is coffee harmful for our health?,Effect of Negative Awareness of Coffee on Its Preference and Recommendation Intention,"ABSTRACTThe information on coffee being beneficial to health is easily accessible via online news and monthly journals, whereas its study of negative effect on health is not, due to public discomfort. However, numerous medical researches have been released. The debate on whether coffee is beneficial or harmful to our health is still ongoing and its consumers are aware of need for further research. Based on such background, this study classifies the negative awareness of coffee by consumers into five factors - addiction/carcino genesis, health risk, side effect, price burden and ingredient hazard. The subjects of study were residents in Seoul and Gyeonggi province, who had experienced coffee and over 20 years of age; and the statistical data was collected using SPSS Win Ver. 18.0 through feasibility analysis, factor analysis, reliability analysis, cluster analysis, one-way ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. This study investigates the negative awareness of coffee and is based on following hypothesis. First, the negative awareness of coffee will affect its preference and recommendation intention. Second, there will be a difference in the negative awareness of coffee, its preference and recommendation intention according to the demographic characteristics. The study has found that addiction/carcino genesis, health risk, side effect and ingredient hazard had effect on coffee preference, and all factors, addiction/carcino genesis, health risk, side effect, price burden and ingredient hazard had effect on recommendation intention. According to the demographic characteristics: age, marital status, occupation and average monthly income, there was a difference in the negative awareness of coffee. In addition, there was a difference in coffee preference according to occupation and education, but the difference in recommendation intention according to demographic characteristics was not analyzed. The analysis also showed that younger subjects were fond of coffee but had high price burden, while older the subjects were, more concerned they were, with overall negative awareness, such as life expectancy and health related risk, the quality of coffee and ingredient hazard.Key words : coffee and health, negative awareness, health risk, price burden, coffee preferenceINTRODUCTIONCoffee has been long loved by many people around the world. As recognized by those who have experienced coffee, it has rich aroma and flavor, which would steadily increase the consumption in the future unless there is special side effect. The cause of rapid increase in recent coffee consumption in Korea can be analyzed in various ways but the tendency toward gourmet coffee with rich aroma and flavor i.e. specialty coffee preference will continue. In addition, with the support of studies reporting health benefits of coffee, thought to be harmless even in large amount, habitual and addictive coffee consumption is prevalent among many people.However, the stimulating or relaxing effect of coffee does not cause the same affective response in everyone. The more people drink, appropriate coffee intake should be noted, and the quality and sanitation of sub ingredients should also be considered to improve the taste. Those who had experienced side effects on their first attempt or with one or more chronic diseases did not drink coffee (Garcia et al, 2013). Furthermore, people stopped drinking coffee rather than going to the hospital in case of indisposition, and then, their conditions have improved. Likewise, coffee has side effects and many studies actually reported the detrimental effect of coffee on health. Most of the side effects of coffee would refer to the side effect of caffeine.

13511,does music improve studying?,Pedagogical Potential of Mental Practice in Teaching Brass Instruments at University,"At any level of musical education, it is very important to improve one’s musicianship skills, which can only be achieved through consistent training and playing their musical instrument. Physical training is a very important part of the learning process; however, its combination with mental practice has been proved to be much more effective. Although such an approach is important at all levels of musical education, the paper addresses it in the context of higher education. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the pedagogical potential of mental practice in the process of teaching music in higher education. The research was implemented in two stages. First, a survey was conducted to gather information about the respondents’ habits when learning musical pieces. At this stage, the study involved 68 brass students from different universities around the world between the ages of 19 and 25. The second stage of the research comprised the development of the program of mental practice (PMP) with structured observation as a method and 7 participants from Latvian and Norwegian higher music education institutions. The obtained results allow to conclude that the inclusion of mental practice in the practicing routine significantly improves the overall level of concentration and stability both in the process of training and during performances. Mental practice also provides an opportunity to increase the duration of training as well as enhances the overall effectiveness of practicing and concentration during performances.","Mental practice in music training improves concentration, stability, and overall effectiveness during performances.",question,1539,115.0
22167,why is abortion not considered murder?,Abortion and human nature,"According to the future of value argument for the immorality of abortion, the best explanation for the presumptive serious wrongness of killing innocent post-natal children and adults is that killing them deprives them of all of the goods of life that they would have experienced had they not been killed. These future goods can be called their “futures of value”. Fetuses have futures (very much!) like ours. Therefore, given some assumptions, ending their lives is seriously presumptively wrong, or so the argument goes.1i

The future of value argument has two parts. (1) It is an account of what is sufficient to make killing presumptively seriously wrong in the cases of all those individuals whom, we all agree, it is wrong to kill. (2) It endorses the implication that it is presumptively seriously wrong to end the life of a fetus. In the first part of this essay I briefly shall discuss the virtues of the future of value account of the wrongness of killing. In the second part I shall discuss how this theory of the wrongness of killing is one aspect of a larger plausible portion of morality. Finally, I shall discuss how, when the future of value account is placed within this larger bit of morality, the relation of the future of value account to some other issues in bioethics can be illuminated.

Although I may, with some justification, be accused of bias in this matter, I believe that the future of value account of the wrongness of killing has a number of virtues.

7192,what does research say about the effect of transfers for football organizations?,Elite sport policies and international sporting success: a panel data analysis of European women’s national football team performance,"ABSTRACT Research question: While national sporting governing bodies are encouraged to implement programmes which seek to enhance their international sporting success, comparative studies on elite sport policies have provided limited empirical evidence in support of the relationship between such programmes and the achievement of sporting outcomes. Following the SPLISS framework, this study examines the longitudinal impact of four programme-level factors – financial support, human resources, coaching provision and foundation phase activity – on the international success of women’s national football teams. Research methods: Data from 55 Union of European Football Associations’ (UEFA) members were collected over a seven-year-period (2011-2017). The associations between programme-level factors and FIFA ranking points are verified through panel regression analyses. Controls for economic, talent pool, political, socio-cultural, climate and men’s football legacy variables are included. Results and Findings: The results reveal that highly specialised coaching provision has a significant and positive impact on international success in women’s football, while our proxies for financial support, human resources and foundation phase activity have no notable explanatory power for the success of women’s national teams. A country’s economic development, talent pool, climate and men’s football legacy are significant predictors of its women’s football performance level. Implications: This paper offers practical insights into the organisation and management of women’s football in UEFA nations and contributes to the theoretical debate on comparative analysis of the sporting performance of countries. This article confirms that an exclusively quantitative approach does not permit definitive conclusions to be drawn on the complex relationship between elite sport policies and international sporting outcomes.",Highly specialized coaching provision has a significant and positive impact on international success in women’s football.,question,1917,121.0

One effective approach to increase the efficiency in inventory management has been resource pooling [2]. However, the emergence of additive manufacturing (AM) enables the new paradigm of production capacity pooling, which varies from current ones. AM’s inherent characteristics may realize capacity sharing among distinct industries, alleviate the need for high safety stock levels and enable better customer service through the reduction of transshipments for spare parts. The advantages can be extended to the broader fulfillment reach of the firm in other geographical areas without expanding its existing production capacity or inventory (and other benefits from a distributed production setting). However, issues with inter-organizational agreements, testing and production reliability may slow down the pooling process while the required facilities are in place.

The primary contributing factors in contracting scabies seem to be poverty and overcrowded living conditions. Scabies often spreads among schoolchildren quite rapidly, owing to their close contact and overcrowding within the schools. However, limited information is available about its risk factors and the socioeconomic correlates among schoolchildren in Egypt. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of scabies and its risk factors among primary schoolchildren in Kafr El-Sheikh administrative area, Egypt. Methods This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on primary schoolchildren in urban and rural areas of Kafr El-Sheikh administrative area. A predesigned questionnaire was used for data collection from the randomly selected 2,104 children, and clinical dermatological examination was done for them. Results Out of 2,104 children studied, there were 92 cases of scabies with a prevalence of 4.4%. The prevalence of scabies infestation in male students was 3.9%, while it was 4.8% in females, with no statistical significance. The results showed significant variations in the risk of scabies infestation by factors such as residence, paternal education and occupation, maternal education, sleeping with others, having animals at home, dealing with animals outside the house, type of building for living, family history of itchy rash, and sharing clothes with others. Conclusion In our community, scabies is still an important health problem affecting schoolchildren, especially in rural areas.

Role clarity, task mastery, and social acceptance are recognized as key resources enabling new professionals’ management of the challenges of the new profession. However, relations between these resources and stress, strain, and burnout have not yet been thoroughly investigated at professional entry. Increased understanding of these relations could have implications for strategies to prevent burnout. The aim of the study was to investigate within- and between-individual effects over the first months and relations to burnout at one-year post-entry. Data (n = 322) was collected weekly over the first 13 weeks and again 9 months later. Relationships were modelled using a multilevel regression model and correlation analysis. Results showed that on weeks when participants experienced higher role clarity, task mastery, and social acceptance, they reported significantly less stress, and that participants who experienced higher levels of the resources in general, reported significantly less strain. Levels of the resources at three months were related to symptoms of burnout at 12 months.

12971,how to cope depression,Reducing Healthcare Costs for Mental Health Hospitalizations With the Evidence-based COPE Program for Child and Adolescent Depression and Anxiety: A Cost Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION
Although depression and anxiety affect approximately 20% of children and adolescents, many of those affected do not receive treatment because, in large part to the shortage of mental health providers across the United States. As an alternative to traditional mental health counseling, the Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE) program is an evidence-based manualized 7-session cognitive behavioral therapy-based program that is being effectively delivered to children and teens with depression and anxiety by pediatric and family healthcare providers in primary care practices with reimbursement from insurers.


METHODS
The purpose of this study was to perform a cost analysis of delivering COPE and compare it to the cost of hospitalization for primary mental health diagnosis.


RESULTS
Findings indicated a cost savings of $14,262 for every hospitalization that is prevented.


DISCUSSION
Implementation of COPE can improve outcomes for children and teens with depression and anxiety, and could potentially result in millions of dollars of cost savings for the U.S. healthcare system.","The COPE program, a 7-session cognitive behavioral therapy-based program, effectively helps children and teens with depression and anxiety.",question,1118,139.0
12679,the impact of trade frictions,International trade and US productivity,"Abstract This paper examines the effects of international trade on US productivity. We argue that trade can affect domestic productivity through economies-of-scale effects, competition effects, reallocation effects, and spillover effects. We then estimate the net impact of these effects. The results of both panel and time-series regressions of manufacturing data indicate that: (1) a decrease in the import price has a positive competition effect on manufacturing productivity growth after 1–2 years, and this impact is bigger when import penetration is bigger; and (2) exporting activity itself does not seem to promote productivity. Our results suggest that the competition effect and/or the reallocation effect are the most powerful among the four channels. Simulation results indicate that import competition accounted for about 32 percent of labor productivity growth in manufacturing during 1996–2001.","A decrease in import price positively impacts manufacturing productivity growth after 1-2 years, especially when import penetration is bigger.",phrase,909,142.0
22499,does peg 150 distearate cause acne?,Investigating the Stability of Benzoyl Peroxide in Over-the-Counter Acne Medications,"One of the most commonly used ingredients in over-the-counter acne treatments in cream, gel, and wash form is benzoyl peroxide. It is an anti-bacterial agent that kills the bacterium (Propionibacterium acne) involved in the formation of acne. The formulation of these products is extremely difficult owing to the instability of benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is soluble in polyethylene glycol (PEG) and isopropyl myristate, but it is not stable in these solvents. Also, it is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in ethanol but is very stable in the presence of these solvents. The stability of benzoyl peroxide in PEG or isopropyl myristate is increased upon addition of water or ethanol. Students take on the role of the process chemist and use peroxide strips to investigate the stability of benzoyl peroxide in an over-the-counter acne medication in solutions of water, ethanol, PEG, 50:50 ethanol:PEG, 50:50 water:PEG, isopropyl myristate, and 50:50 ethanol:isopropyl myristate.","Benzoyl peroxide, a common ingredient in acne treatments, is more stable in solutions of water or ethanol, despite being more soluble in polyethylene glycol and isopropyl myristate.",question,1007,181.0
20543,what are the effects of homeless encampment sweeps?,"Governed by atmospheres: Affect, materiality and everyday benevolence in homeless encampments during the COVID-19 pandemic","This article explores the operation of homeless encampments as a part of governance by highlighting the role of affective atmospheres. The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of lockdowns have seen the introduction of unprecedented measures into homelessness governance in Czech cities. Some have set up temporary homeless encampments as a response to the declaration of the state of emergency. Relying on interviews and observations, this article reveals that such measures in cities differed significantly in both character and outcomes. Based on a repeated instances comparison of the socio-material and affective entanglements of operating two emergency encampments – one in the regional city of Pilsen and the other in the capital city of Prague – the article argues that affective atmospheres play a vital role in their practical operations and perceived outcomes. While no simple dichotomy is implied, in Pilsen, order was implemented through a surveillance logic that instigated conflicts and created an atmosphere of frustration, while in Prague, the benevolence and mutuality of people in the camp led to a relaxed atmosphere. The article introduces the notion of ‘governed by atmospheres’ and argues that it opens space for a more complex and nuanced examination of the unintended outcomes of particular policies and politics in homelessness governance.","Homeless encampment measures during COVID-19 differed in outcomes, with surveillance logic causing conflicts and frustration in Pilsen, while benevolence and mutuality led to a relaxed atmosphere in Prague.",question,1365,206.0
15594,does group selection actually occur?,"Continuous-time models of group selection, and the dynamical insufficiency of kin selection models.","Traditionally, the process of group selection has been described mathematically by discrete-time models, and analyzed using tools like the Price equation.

In many important examples (like hunter-gatherer tribes) there are no mass-dispersion events, and the group-level events that do occur, like fission, fusion, and extinction, occur asynchronously. Examples like these can be fully analyzed by the equations of two-level population dynamics (described here) so their models are dynamically sufficient. However, it will be shown that examples like these cannot be fully analyzed by kin selection (inclusive fitness) methods because kin selection versions of group selection models are not dynamically sufficient.

16662,what is the impact of affirmative action on public sector performance?,Affirmative Action and the Presidential Role in Modern Civil Rights Reform: A Sampler of Books of the 1990s,"Equal Employment Opportunity/Disparate Impact Primary sources of employment affirmative action are authoritatively documented in Hugh Davis Graham's magisterial The Civil Rights Era (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990). One major foundation of affirmative action was President Richard Nixon's ""Philadelphia Plan,"" which forbade racial discrimination by federal contractors and mandated them to implement ""affirmative action plans"" for hiring ""underutilized"" members of protected groups in proportion to their availability.(1) Another major pillar of affirmative action was the U.S. Supreme Court's determination that the ban on employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964(2) reached historical and societal bias against minority groups as well as intentional discrimination against minority individuals (Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 [ 1971]). The legacy of Griggs has been a theory of Title VII liability known as ""disparate impact""; if a minority/female (i.e., protected) group has been disproportionately affected by societal bias, then its members, solely because of their membership, are entitled to proportional representation in the job market. This entitlement may be defeated in a particular case only by the employer's showing of a ""business necessity"" for the disproportionate impact. Disparate impact and proportional representation were not mentioned in the 1964 act. The upshot of these initiatives has been the institutionalization of minority/female protected group compensatory remedies in employment. This is the gist of affirmative action as we know it: compensatory advantage as the only authentic sanction for group discrimination. In this sense also, affirmative action was not mentioned in the 1964 act. Graham(3) and other scholars of comparable stature see in it an administrative and judicial departure from the literal statutory language in obedience to an equitable imperative, not merely to outlaw discrimination but also to repair its damages. On the other hand, much of our white majority sees in it intolerable ""reverse discrimination"" and compulsory minority quotas. No current domestic issue is more controversial, and in the midst of it, the Supreme Court (as of late) might be in the process of banishing disparate impact/ affirmative action for those performing government work. As could be expected, a spate of affirmative action books pours from the presses. Some of them supplement Graham's account of disparate impact. Alfred Blumrosen's Modern Law (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993) and Herman Belz's Equality Transformed (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1991) display all the trappings of legal scholarship--weighty legalisms, copious footnotes and citations, and all the rest. Both clearly are the work of true believers, and they present totally irreconcilable views of disparate impact. Blumrosen cavalierly brushes aside the explicit statutory restriction of Title VII liability to intentional violations of individual rights. He maintains that disparate impact came into being because intentional discrimination is too difficult to prove and is, in any event, legitimately inferable from the 1964 act's failure to define discrimination.(4) Belz, on other hand, regards the notions of societal bias and group rights as anathema--gross perversions of the 1964 act.(5) Readers skilled in legal argumentation are invited to decide for themselves which of these stimulating and learned tracts has the better of it. In addition, for those who want training in the central legalisms of affirmative action, both books are highly desirable. The theme of Graham's Civil Rights Era, which primarily covers the period 1960 to 1972, is that there have been two civil rights phases since 1960. The first (""Phase I"") essentially focused on prohibiting intentional racial, national origin, and sex discrimination. The second (""Phase II""), continuing after Nixon's ""Philadelphia Plan"" played a major role in launching it, expanded the aforementioned ""equal treatment"" antidiscrimination policy to include both a ban on unintentional group discrimination and a cultivation of compensatory remediation for protected minorities and females, that is, affirmative action to secure ""equal results. …","Affirmative action, as we understand it today, is a compensatory advantage for group discrimination, despite not being explicitly mentioned in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",question,4288,169.0

Wistar rats were supplied daily with HMB (320 mg/kg body weight diluted in NaCl-0.9%) or vehicle only (control) by gavage for 28 days. After this period, some of the animals were subjected to a 24-h fasting, while others remained in the fed condition. The EDL muscle was then removed, weighed and used to evaluate the genes and proteins involved in protein synthesis (AKT/4E-BP1/S6) and degradation (Fbxo32 and Trim63). A sub-set of rats were used to measure in vivo muscle contractile function. HMB supplementation increased AKT phosphorylation during fasting (three-fold). In the fed condition, no differences were detected in atrogenes expression between control and HMB supplemented group; however, HMB supplementation did attenuate the fasting-induced increase in their expression levels. Fasting animals receiving HMB showed improved sustained tetanic contraction times (one-fold) and an increased muscle to tibia length ratio (1.3-fold), without any cross-sectional area changes.

The design features of the system include: the rules of intervention, the limits placed on exchange rates and the ""crisis scenario"" which describes possible transitions to new regimes in case one central bank runs out of reserves or borrowing capacity. This paper considers the various trade-offs one faces in designing an exchange-rate system. Svensson (1989) has already analyzed the degree of variability in the exchange rate, the interest rate and the fundamentals. But the tradeoff also pertains to the amount of reserves which the central banks must have on hand in order to forestall a speculative attack and make the system sustainable. The amount of reserves needed depends crucially on the assured crisis scenario.","Exchange-rate systems are designed with rules of intervention, limits on exchange rates, and crisis scenarios, which depend on central banks' reserves and borrowing capacity.",question,843,174.0
4520,is diabetes one the most common health issues,Complications in Advanced Diabetics in a Tertiary Care Centre: A Retrospective Registry-Based Study.,"INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a major public health problem in our country and complications of diabetes are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. There is a need to quantify the complications in order to improve our strategies for prevention and management.


AIM
To measure the prevalence of complications in type 2 diabetics following up at a tertiary care centre and to study its association with the socio-demographic and clinical parameters.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective record based study was conducted on 3261 type 2 diabetic patients on insulin therapy, recorded in the diabetic registry maintained at Goa Medical College from Aug 2009 to May 2012. Data on anthropometric measurements, demographic characteristics, complications and other details were extracted from these records.


RESULTS
Out of the 3261 patients 1025 (31.4%) had macrovascular complications and 1122 (34.4%) had at least one microvascular complication. The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease and stroke were 6.7%, 21.3% and 6.6% respectively and were significantly higher in males. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy were 16.7%, 16.5% and 16.3% respectively with diabetic nephropathy being significantly higher in males. Trend analysis showed significant association of rising prevalence of all complications with age (p<0.05). Duration of diabetes also showed significantly positive trend for all complications (p<0.05) except stroke.


CONCLUSION
The study presents the prevalence of diabetic complications in patients reporting to a tertiary hospital in Goa. Coronary artery disease was found to be the most common complication. As age and duration of diabetes were found to be significantly associated, efforts should be made towards promoting earlier diagnosis of diabetes so as to improve management and decrease the chances of complications.","Diabetes is a major public health problem, and in this study, coronary artery disease was the most common complication among type 2 diabetic patients.",question,1902,150.0
18471,what are the sources of variation in broiler nutrition experiments?,The dietary effect of different wheat cultivars for broiler chickens,"1. An experiment was conducted to examine the variability in chemical composition of 16 wheat cultivars and to study how this variability affected the performance of broiler chickens given diets containing 650 or 815 g wheat/kg diet during the first 3 weeks of life. Intestinal viscosity, apparent fat digestibility and apparent metabolisable energy were determined with all diets. Intestinal pH and the relative weight of different parts of the intestine were measured in chickens fed on diets with the high wheat inclusion. 2. The 16 wheat cultivars varied in chemical composition, with protein content ranging from 112 to 127 g/kg dry matter, starch content from 658 to 722 g/kg dry matter and non-starch polysaccharides from 98 to 117 g/kg dry matter. The effect of the different wheat cultivars on the measured parameters was most pronounced in chickens fed on diets with 815 g wheat/kg diet ( P <0.001). However, significant ( P <0.001) differences between cultivars were still present at the lower wheat content. 3. Milling-quality wheats resulted in better performance ( P <0.001) than feeding-quality wheats at the high inclusion, whereas such an effect could not be registered in diets at the lower wheat inclusion. These results indicate that some of the feeding wheats are comparable in quality to milling wheats when included at the concentrations which are more common in practical broiler diets. 4. Decreasing the wheat content in the diets resulted in significantly ( P <0.001) better performance and considerably ( P <0.001) lower intestinal viscosity (jejunum; 2.4 to 5.9 cps, ileum; 4.6 to 10.9 cps) than in chickens fed on diets with the higher wheat inclusion level (jejunum; 9.1 to 38.4 cps, ileum; 20.8 to 82.0 cps). 5. Diets with 815 g wheat/kg influenced pH in the caeca, but not in the ileum and gizzard. The relative weights of the gizzard and ileum differed significantly ( P <0.05) between treatments, whereas those of duodenum, jejunum and caeca were not affected by dietary addition of the different wheat cultivars. 6. The present study demonstrated that the chemical composition and the nutritive value of Danish wheats for broilers vary markedly. The results indicated that the non-starch polysaccharide and especially the arabinoxylan content of wheat are important factors in the discussion of the result obtained. Poor correlations were seen between performance and AME n and care should be taken when using AME n values alone to predict the nutritive value of wheat and wheat-based diets.","Variation in broiler nutrition experiments can come from differences in wheat cultivars' chemical composition, such as protein, starch, and non-starch polysaccharide content.",question,2526,174.0

7813,the performance of failure on tunnel,Stability analysis of the tunnel face in the cohesive-frictional soils considering the arch effect and rotational mechanism,"ABSTRACT This article proposes a new 3D failure mechanism to analyze the stability of the tunnel face driven by a closed shield in cohesive-frictional soils. The failure mechanism consists of a single block in the lower part defined by logarithmic-spiral and a distributed force caused by the weight of a half-ellipsoid in the upper part. The logarithmic-spiral surface represents the shear band and the distributed force is applied to simulate the arch effect. The arch effect and rotational mechanism are considered simultaneously. Comparisons among the proposed mechanism, numerical simulation and existing mechanism are conducted. The results show that the proposed mechanism provides improved limit support pressure values, and the failure patterns of the proposed mechanism agree well with those of the numerical simulation and experimental tests. This verifies that the proposed mechanism is effective and reasonable.","The proposed 3D failure mechanism effectively analyzes tunnel face stability in cohesive-frictional soils, providing improved limit support pressure values and accurate failure patterns.",phrase,924,186.0
20218,what is the association between bullying and dentistry?,A Survey of the Prevalence and Predictors of Workplace Bullying Towards the Dental Hygienist.,"OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE
Given the lack of research within dentistry as it relates to workplace bullying (WPB), the purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of WPB and predictors of WPB for dental hygienists in clinical practice.


METHODS
Cross-sectional survey research was used with a convenience sample of dental hygienists (n=943) providing patient care to explore WPB. Ninety-three percent of participants resided in the United States, and 6.9% lived internationally. The survey was shared via social media on Facebook and Instagram group pages, specifically dental focused. The validated Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R) was used to measure the exposure WPB using descriptive, correlation, chi-square and Mann-Whitney U.


RESULTS
The completion rate was 81% (n=765). Results showed 21% of participants had experienced WPB now and then, 9.4% several times a week, and 2.9% almost daily. Predictors for WPB included highest degree earned (p=-0.03), US (United States) region of residence (p=0.001), clinical setting (private practice versus dental service organization) (p<0.001), clinical years of experience (p=0.002), and work status (full- or part-time) (p=0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
The findings confirmed WPB has been experienced by 1 in 5 clinical dental hygienists. Dental hygienists in their early years are more likely to have reported workplace bullying than those with more years of practice. WPB is not a new phenomenon, but given the prevalence observed in dental hygiene participants, employers need to be active in preventing and managing bullying to create and maintain an effective dental team and positive work environment.","Workplace bullying has been experienced by 1 in 5 clinical dental hygienists, with those in their early years more likely to report it.",question,1657,135.0
23838,how does emotional intelligence of followers affect the leader's leadership style?,Combinative aspects of leadership style and emotional intelligence,"– The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the leader’s emotional intelligence influences the leader’s preferences for different ways of combining leadership behaviors (i.e. combinative aspects of leadership style). , – The authors used a hybrid design to collect the data to avoid common-method biases. The authors described a high-stress workplace in a vignette and asked participants to rank four styles of combining a task-oriented leadership (i.e. Pressure) statement and a socio-emotional leadership (i.e. Support) statement. The authors then asked participants to complete a Likert-scale based questionnaire on emotional intelligence. , – The authors found that leaders who prefer to provide Support immediately before Pressure have higher levels of emotional intelligence than do leaders who prefer the three other combinative styles. Leaders who prefer to provide Pressure and Support separately (i.e. provide Pressure 30 minutes after Support) have the lowest levels of emotional intelligence. , – A key implicit assumption in the work is that leaders do not want to evoke negative emotions in followers. The authors did not take into account factors that influence leadership style which participating managers would be likely to encounter on a daily basis such as the relationship with the follower, the follower’s level of performance and work experience, the gender of the leader and the gender of the follower, the hierarchical levels of the leader and follower, and the followers’ preferred combinative style. The nature of the sample and the use of a hypothetical scenario are other limitations of the study. , – Providing leadership behaviors that are regarded as effective is necessary but not enough because the emotional impact of leadership behaviors appears to also depend on how the behaviors are configured. , – This is the first study to show that the emotional intelligence of leaders is related to their preferences for the manner in which they combine task and social leadership statements. Furthermore, two-factor theories of leadership propose that the effects of task and social leadership are additive. However, the findings show that the effects are interactive.","Leaders with higher emotional intelligence prefer to provide Support immediately before Pressure, while those with lower emotional intelligence prefer to provide Pressure and Support separately.",question,2203,194.0
22941,does homeopathic muscle testing work?,Skeletal Muscle Power Measurement in Older People: A Systematic Review of Testing Protocols and Adverse Events,"Background
Muscle power has been proposed to be the primary therapeutic target for resistance training interventions aimed at enhancing physical function in older adults. However, no recommendations exist on ideal testing protocols to assess muscle power in older adults, and the safety of this procedure has not been adequately evaluated in the literature.


Methods
A systematic review was conducted to identify studies evaluating muscle power exerted by older people in resistance exercises through May 2017. Information from muscle power testing protocols regarding familiarization, warm-up, measuring instrument, exercise, intensity, volume, rest intervals, data collection, and analysis was collected, as well as that regarding adverse events. Reporting bias was evaluated according to the recommendations given by the Cochrane Collaboration group.


Results
From 65 studies that met inclusion criteria, 3,484 older subjects and 11,841 muscle power tests distributed in 6,105 testing sessions were identified. A full description of the different muscle power testing protocols was conducted. In addition, a risk of adverse events of 0.15%-0.69% (one adverse event every 144-658 muscle power tests) was found. However, adverse events were poorly reported, with most of the studies showing a high risk of reporting bias.


Conclusions
Major discrepancies were found in muscle power testing protocols among studies. This might limit consensus on designing optimal training programs to improve muscle power and physical function in older adults, and understanding the main mechanisms involved in the age-related loss of muscle power. Finally, muscle power testing was found to be safe in older people with a broad range of health and functional states.",Muscle power testing in older adults was found to be safe with a risk of adverse events between 0.15%-0.69%.,question,1754,108.0
20125,negative effects of large classes on the teacher and its students,"Class size, pupil attentiveness and peer relations.","BACKGROUND
Despite a long-running debate over the effects of class size differences on educational performance there is little evidence on the classroom processes that might be involved.


AIMS
The effects of class size differences are examined in relation to social and behavioural adjustment to school, in terms of two dimensions: attentiveness and peer relations. It was predicted that as class size increased there would be more inattentiveness in class and more signs of social difficulties between children in the form of more rejection, asocial, anxious and aggressive behaviour, and less prosocial behaviour.


SAMPLES
Data came from a large-scale longitudinal study of children over KS1 (4-7 years). The observation study was based on a subsample of 235 children in 21 small (average 19 children) and 18 large (average 33 children) reception classes (aged 5 years). The PBR sample involved over 5,000.


METHODS
There were two complementary methods of data collection: first, a systematic observation study of pre-selected target children in terms of three 'social modes' - when with their teachers, other children and when not interacting - and in terms of work, procedural, social and off-task activities; and, second, a teacher administered Pupil Behaviour Rating (PBR) scale comprising over 50 items rated on a 3-point scale grouped into six 'factors': hyperactive/distractible, aggressive, anxious/ fearful, prosocial, asocial, and excluded.


RESULTS
Observations showed that children in large classes were more likely to show off-task behaviour of all kinds, and more likely to interact with their peers in terms of off-task behaviour, social, and also on-task behaviours. Connections between class size and PBR factors were not strong. There was no support for the view that peer relations are better in smaller classes; indeed, there was a slight tendency for worse peer relations, in terms of aggression, asocial and excluded, in the smallest classes.


CONCLUSIONS
There was confirmation that children in large classes are more distracted from work and more often off task. The unexpected result, based on teacher ratings, that small classes may lead to less social and more aggressive relations between children is discussed, along with implications for teachers of a tendency for more peer-related contacts in large classes.","Children in large classes are more distracted from work and more often off task, with a tendency for more peer-related contacts.",phrase,2346,128.0

5251,what predicts success as a startup founder?,"The necessity of targeted aptitude diagnostics for company founders: relationships between personality traits, perceived stress, satisfaction, and performance","In the course of a growing start-up market and strongly increasing investment volume, investors try to predict the success of a business as precisely as possible in advance. However, when assessing the personality of the founder or founding team, they still rely far too often on their gut feeling, thereby reducing the quality of their decisions. Our study therefore aimed at investigating whether there are any relationships between the founders' personality traits and their performance and thus justifying the need for more targeted and optimized diagnostics in the field of founder personality. With a total of 141 founders, clear correlations between personality traits (conscientiousness, emotional stability) and performance could be demonstrated in the present study. In addition, it became evident that perceived stress is also related to the founders’ personality (emotional stability negative, conscientiousness positive) and in turn has a negative effect on performance. Our findings contribute to raising awareness of the importance of personality as a predictor of founders' performance, improving decision-making, and, in the long run, replacing gut feeling as an inappropriate assessment criterion of investors.",Personality traits like conscientiousness and emotional stability are correlated with startup founders' performance and can predict their success.,question,1228,146.0

Social media users who are increasingly massive make this phenomenon a popular culture that is currently rife on social media such as Instagram. Cancel culture can be interpreted as a community's collective effort to 'boycott' someone for their actions or words, which are considered to have violated existing social norms. The cancel culture process is often carried out via the internet or through social media, where this action is in the form of punishment for individuals in cyberspace. Cancel culture cases can happen to public figures such as celebrities, influencers, etc. Public figures affected by the cancellation will have an impact both virtual and real.

22308,why is abortion not considered murder?,The public health threat of anti-abortion legislation.,"What happens when abortion access is severely restricted for 26 million Americans? Texas is about to find out. In July 2013, the Texas legislature passed one of the country’s most restrictive laws that not only bans most abortions after 22 weeks and limits the use of medical abortion but also contains several provisions that are likely to lead to the closure of most abortion clinics in the state. The law requires facilities to meet the standards of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and mandates physicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Proponents of the law claim it will improve safety, despite overwhelming evidence that abortions provided in outpatient clinics have a very low level of complications [1]. This legislation comes on the heels of measures passed in 2011 that drastically reduced funding for family planning, effectively removed Planned Parenthood from all state-funded family planning programs and required women seeking abortion to make an extra visit at least 24 hours before the abortion in order to undergo an ultrasound and listen to a detailed description of its images. 
 
Texas is only one of several states attempting to regulate abortion out of existence — a trend that should be deeply troubling to the medical community. First, it represents a stunning incursion into the physician’s exam room, allowing state representatives to dictate how doctors should practice medicine. Second, it is in blatant contradiction to evidence-based medicine. One of the provisions of the Texas law requires doctors to follow the regimen for medical abortion included in the mifepristone labeling approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000, or the dosage included in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) practice bulletin published in 2005. Both of these documents are out of date, and most US providers use a newer protocol that has been widely studied and found to be safe, effective and acceptable to patients [2,3]. Yet even when the ACOG bulletin is updated, physicians in Texas will be prohibited from following its revised recommendations. 
 
Most concerning, however, is the effect this law will have on the health of Texas women — especially low-income and young women who lack the resources to travel to clinics in a distant city or out of state — and the potential rise of abortion self-induction. In 2012, we conducted a survey with 318 women seeking abortion in six cities across the state to assess the impact of the 2011 restrictions. We found that 7% of women reported taking something on their own in order to try to end their current pregnancy before coming to the abortion clinic. This proportion was even higher — about 12% — among women at clinics near the Mexican border. Misoprostol and herbs were the methods women more commonly mentioned. By comparison, a nationally representative survey of abortion patients in 2008 found that 2.6% reported ever taking something to attempt to self-induce an abortion [4]. The confluence of extremely limited access to abortion in the context of poverty, access to misoprostol from Mexico, as well as familiarity with the practice of self-induction in Latin America, makes it particularly likely that self-induction will become more commonplace in Texas. 
 
Early medical abortion with misoprostol is a safe and effective regimen and is recommended by the World Health Organization in settings without access to mifepristone [5]. But if women do not have accurate information, they may use ineffective dosages and may not realize the abortion failed until much later in pregnancy, forcing them to seek a second-trimester abortion or continue the pregnancy and have a child they do not want or feel they cannot care for. Using misoprostol in the second trimester also increases the risk of hemorrhage that might require surgical intervention or transfusion, as well as the risk of uterine rupture if inappropriately high dosages are used, especially with a history of prior cesarean delivery [6]. And while misoprostol is unquestionably a safe method to self-induce abortion [7], women may use a variety of less effective and more dangerous methods to end a pregnancy on their own, including taking herbs or self-inflicting abdominal trauma [8]. 
 
Women’s health may also be negatively impacted by a rise in the number of second-trimester abortions in Texas caused by delays accessing care. Of the 34 abortion clinics that were open in October 2013, twelve closed in November when the law was allowed to go into effect and physicians were unable to secure hospital privileges. Of the clinics open in November 2013, only three are currently licensed ASCs. Although several new ASCs are planned, it will take time—and money — before there is a sufficient number of surgery centers to meet demand in the state, where approximately 70,000 abortions are performed annually. The limited number of providers will undoubtedly result in delays in obtaining an abortion, pushing women later in pregnancy, when the procedure is associated with a higher risk of complication [9] and is more expensive. 
 
As an example, consider what might happen in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, an area of Texas along the Mexican border. The four counties that make up the Valley are home to about 275,000 women of reproductive age, about two thirds of whom are estimated to be in need of subsidized contraceptive services. This area was particularly hard hit by the cuts in public family planning funds mandated by the state legislature in 2011. State funding to family planning clinics in the Valley dropped from $4.3 million in 2010 to $1.4 million in 2012, resulting in numerous clinic closures, significant reductions in service hours at many remaining locations, and limited availability of the most effective contraceptive methods (e.g., intrauterine devices and implants). 
 
In 2011, 2634 women living in the Valley obtained an abortion. Both of the abortion clinics in the Valley closed in November 2013 because physicians were unable to obtain hospital privileges. The nearest clinic is in Corpus Christi, 150 miles away, and the nearest ASC is in San Antonio, about 250 miles away, adding up to eight hours of travel time to the process of obtaining an abortion. If a woman chooses a medical abortion, state law requires her to make this long journey at least three times. These barriers are likely to be too great for many women. 
 
Evidence from other countries indicates that severely restricting abortion does not reduce its incidence — it simply makes unsafe abortion more common [10,11]. A handful of countries have made abortion illegal for all indications, but most of these countries are either very small and susceptible to external influence, such as the Dominican Republic or Nicaragua, or imposed these restrictions under a dictatorship, as was the case in Chile and Romania. While Texas does not exactly fit into either of these categories, it is notable that the restrictive abortion bill was not able to move out of committee during the regular legislative session, and the governor had to call two special sessions in order to get it passed. 
 
It remains to be seen what will happen in the Valley and throughout Texas. Parts of the new abortion law may be blocked by the courts, and the effect on abortion services may not be as extreme as projected. But one thing is certain: the population of Texas has taken notice of the legislature’s actions. For several weeks in June and July, activists swelled the Capitol in Austin and made their voices heard. As the fight for abortion rights in Texas moves from the legislature to the courts, it is critical that reproductive health specialists — both clinicians and researchers — add their voices to this outcry, highlighting the negative impact of these restrictions and demanding that all women have the right to comprehensive health care services.","Restrictive abortion laws can lead to a rise in self-induced abortions and negatively impact women's health, especially for low-income and young women.",question,7929,151.0
18947,the importance of comparative studies,The Importance of Being Comparative,"My choice of topic on this occasion is the importance of comparative analysis.1 We have, of course, always known that we should be comparative, since comparison is a part of scientific method and even of commonsense. Hence, at the institutional level, we have understood that whenever possible we should study more than one college or university at a time in order to look for similarities and differences among the cases and then explore the causes and the consequences of common and unique features. And then as we have moved to the level of state systems, we have understood that it is better to study two, three, four or more states rather than attempt to generalize from just one. Hence our conception of the relation of higher education to government at the state level in the United States has improved considerably as we have ceased to use only materials from California. It is then only one more step to go to the national-system level, there to compare national systems of higher education. In my comments on analysis at this level, I want to do three things: first, to give some examples of how cross-national comparison can be instructive; second, to make a special point of the crucial importance of studying academic power or authority comparatively; and third, to offer several guides for future research.","Comparative analysis is important as it helps identify similarities and differences among cases, and explore the causes and consequences of common and unique features.",phrase,1320,167.0
3140,relation between anxiety and therapy expectations,"The relation between outcome expectation, therapeutic alliance, and outcome among depressed patients in group cognitive-behavioral therapy","Abstract Objective: Although patients’ expectation for improvement correlates with their treatment outcome, there remains limited information regarding the mechanisms through which outcome expectation influences outcome. Although several studies have revealed alliance as a mediator of the expectancy-outcome relation, most have focused on individual psychotherapy only. More research is needed examining mediators, including alliance quality, of the outcome expectation-outcome relation in group therapy. Method: This study focused on such associative chains among 91 depressed outpatients who completed 10 weeks of group cognitive-behavioral therapy. We conducted simple and multiple mediation analyses, accounting for the nested data structure. Results: As predicted, we found: (i) The relations between baseline outcome expectation and both posttreatment anxiety and depression were mediated by alliance quality; (ii) the early therapy outcome expectation-posttreatment anxiety relation was mediated by mid-treatment alliance; (iii) the relation between early alliance and posttreatment interpersonal problems was mediated by during-therapy outcome expectation; and (iv) the relation between baseline outcome expectation and posttreatment interpersonal problems was mediated by two variables acting in turn, early alliance and during-therapy outcome expectation. All other tested models were not significant. Conclusions: Results suggest that bidirectional relations between outcome expectation and alliance, with both directions influencing outcome. Clinical and empirical implications are discussed.","Outcome expectation and alliance quality in group cognitive-behavioral therapy are bidirectionally related, both influencing anxiety and depression outcomes.",phrase,1605,157.0

23827,does exercise decrease hrv?,Effect of supervised integrated exercise on heart rate variability in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"BACKGROUND
Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects autonomic nervous system modulation of cardiac activity. There is a relationship between degrees of physical activity, HRV changes and the risk of cardiovascular disease.


AIM
To study the effect of a supervised integrated exercise programme on HRV in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).


METHODS
The study group consisted of 48 patients (27 males, mean age 62+/-7 years) with type 2 diabetes, of whom 28 underwent a special exercise programme whereas the remaining 20 did not and served as the control group. The supervised integrated exercise programme was applied for a period of 9 months. Deep breathing time domain HRV (difference between the shortest and the longest R-R interval over one minute) was measured at baseline and after 3, 6 and 9 months.


RESULTS
A significant improvement in the HRV values was observed with increasing duration of exercise (13.03+/-1.08 beats/min at baseline versus 16.5+/-1.11 beats/min at 9 months, p <0.001) whereas HRV decreased in the control group (14.85+/-1.15 beats/min at baseline vs. 14.30+/-1.75 at 9 months, p <0.05). Favourable changes in HRV in the exercise group were gender-dependent and were significant in males (12.4+/-1.76 beats/min at baseline vs. 16.18+/-1.91 at 9 months, p <0.001) whereas in females only a trend towards HRV improvement was observed. The HRV changes were also age-dependent and were more pronounced in younger patients than in the elderly. The metabolic parameters of diabetes control (blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels) significantly improved in the exercise group and significantly worsened in the control group.


CONCLUSIONS
Regular supervised integrated exercise significantly improves HRV in patients with type 2 DM, which may favourably influence their long-term prognosis.",Regular supervised integrated exercise significantly improves HRV in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,question,1821,108.0

This study investigated the effectiveness of protein supplementation combined with exercise training (PS + ET) in improving muscle mass and functional outcomes in older adults with lower-limb OA. A comprehensive search of online databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of PS + ET in older adults with hip or knee OA. Meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment of the included RCTs were conducted. Six RCTs were included in this systemic review; they had a median (range/total) Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) score of 7 (6–9) out of 10, respectively. Five RCTs that enrolled patients who underwent total joint replacement were included in this meta-analysis. The PS + ET group exhibited significant improvements in muscle mass (standard mean difference [SMD] = 1.13, p < 0.00001), pain (SMD = 1.36, p < 0.00001), and muscle strength (SMD = 0.44, p = 0.04). Our findings suggest that PS + ET improves muscle mass, muscle strength, and functional outcomes and reduces pain in older adults with lower-limb OA, particularly in those who have undergone total joint replacement.","Protein supplementation combined with exercise training improves muscle mass, muscle strength, and functional outcomes in older adults with lower-limb osteoarthritis.",question,1254,166.0

23106,is insulin going to be replaced with glp diabetes,Long-lasting antidiabetic effect of a dipeptidyl peptidase IV-resistant analog of glucagon-like peptide-1.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1(7-37) (GLP-1) is the most potent insulinotropic hormone characterized thus far. Because its activity is preserved in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients, it is considered a potential new drug for the treatment of this disease. One limitation in its therapeutic use is a short half-life in vivo (5 minutes), due in part to a fast degradation by the endoprotease dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV). Recently, it was reported that GLP-1 became resistant to DPPIV when the alanine residue at position 8 was replaced by a glycine (GLP-1-Gly8). We report here that this change slightly decreased the affinity of the peptide for its receptor (IC50, 0.41 +/- 0.14 and 1.39 +/- 0.61 nmol/L for GLP-1 and GLP-1-Gly8, respectively) but did not change the efficiency to stimulate accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (EC50, 0.25 +/- 0.05 and 0.36 +/- 0.06 nmol/L for GLP-1 and GLP-1-Gly8, respectively). Second, we demonstrate for the first time that this mutant has an improved insulinotropic activity compared with the wild-type peptide when tested in vivo in an animal model of diabetes. A single injection of 0.1 nmol GLP-1-Gly8 in diabetic mice fed a high-fat diet can correct fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance for several hours, whereas the activity of 1 nmol GLP-1 vanishes a few minutes after injection. These actions were correlated with increased insulin and decreased glucagon levels. Interestingly, normoglycemia was maintained over a period that was longer than the predicted peptide half-life, suggesting a yet undescribed long-term effect of GLP-1-Gly8. GLP-1-Gly8 thus has a markedly improved therapeutic potential compared with GLP-1, since it can be used at much lower doses and with a more flexible schedule of administration.","GLP-1-Gly8, a modified version of GLP-1, has improved therapeutic potential for diabetes treatment due to its longer-lasting insulinotropic activity and more flexible administration schedule.",question,1817,191.0

1693,does smoking increase risk cancer risk?,Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer,"Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 15 classes of cancer. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5,243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clock-like mutational process. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.

However, the mechanical performance and high prices of PBAT limit its current usage at the commercial level. To improve the properties and reduce the cost of PBAT, pine resin derivatives, gum rosin (GR) and pentaerythritol ester of GR (UT), were proposed as sustainable additives. For this purpose, PBAT was blended with 5, 10, and 15 wt.% of additives by melt-extrusion followed by injection moulding. The overall performance of the formulations was assessed by tensile test, microstructural, thermal, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The results showed that although good miscibility of both resins with PBAT matrix was achieved, GR in 10 wt.% showed better interfacial adhesion with the PBAT matrix than UT. The thermal characterization suggested that GR and UT reduce PBAT melting enthalpy and enhance its thermal stability, improving PBAT processability. A 10 wt.% of GR significantly increased the tensile properties of PBAT, while a 15 wt.% of UT maintained PBAT tensile performance. The obtained materials showed higher hydrophobicity than neat PBAT. Thus, GR and UT demonstrated that they are advantageous additives for PBAT–resin compounding for rigid food packaging which are easy to process and adequate for industrial scalability. At the same time, they enhance its mechanical and hydrophobic performance.","Pine resin derivatives, gum rosin (GR) and pentaerythritol ester of GR (UT), are used as sustainable additives to improve the properties and reduce the cost of biodegradable PBAT polymer in food packaging.",question,1445,205.0

Probiotics as living microorganisms may theoretically be responsible for 4 types of side effects in susceptible individuals: infections, deleterious metabolic activities, excessive immune stimulation, and gene transfer. Very few cases of infection have been observed. These occurred mainly in very sick patients who received probiotic drugs because of severe medical conditions. Prebiotics exert an osmotic effect in the intestinal lumen and are fermented in the colon. They may induce gaseousness and bloating. Abdominal pain and diarrhea only occur with large doses. An increase in gastroesophageal reflux has recently been associated with large daily doses.

The aim of this work was to characterize the mitochondrial genome of S. lycopersici CIDEFI-216, to use it to trace taxonomic relationships with other fungal taxa and to get insights into the evolutionary history of this phytopathogen. The complete mitochondrial genome was assembled into a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of 75,911 bp that harbors a set of 37 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes (rns and rnl) and 28 tRNA genes, which are transcribed from both sense and antisense strands. Remarkably, its gene repertoire lacks both atp8 and atp9, contains a free-standing gene for the ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) and includes 13 genes with homing endonuclease domains that are mostly located within its 15 group I introns. Strikingly, subunits 1 and 2 of cytochrome oxidase are encoded by a single continuous open reading frame (ORF). A comparative mitogenomic analysis revealed the large extent of structural rearrangements among representatives of Pleosporales, showing the plasticity of their mitochondrial genomes.

23137,will ai destroy humanity?,Unsavory medicine for technological civilization: Introducing ‘Artificial Intelligence & its Discontents’,"This is, once again, the Age of Artificial Intelligence (Garvey 2018c). AI, the suite of techniques intended to make machines capable of performing tasks considered ‘intelligent’ when performed by people, is an epochal technology now colonizing an increasing number of domains, from Internet search and social media to the natural and social sciences; agriculture, banking, criminal sentencing, decision-making, and beyond. AI may soon become ubiquitous, coextensive with technological civilization itself: a taken-for-granted feature of modernity like running water or electricity. But this does not mean that all is well. While AI promises to liberate and empower users, improve well-being, support social institutions, and enable sustainable development, it also threatens to automate and entrench precarity and illiberalism, degrademental health, and accelerate the Earth’s ecological collapse. Freud (1961) famously observed that civilization, despite being ostensibly intended to protect humanity from misery, is paradoxically a great source of unhappiness. Similarly, AI is both touted as the solution to humanity’s biggest problems and decried as one of the biggest problems humankind has ever faced – even, perhaps, its last. A plethora of pundits posit that AI poses an existential risk to human survival on this planet: If not nuclear war, climate catastrophe, or another global pandemic, then it will be ‘superintelligent’ machines that herald the Apocalypse (Barrat 2013; Bostrom 2014; Clark 2014; Yampolskiy 2015; Müller 2016; Cava 2018; Russell 2019).

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much empirical evidence on how people perceive the skills of AI in these domains. In Experiment 1, participants were exposed to AI-generated audiovisual artwork and were asked to evaluate it. We told half of the participants that the artist was a human and we confessed to the other half that it was an AI. Although all of them were exposed to the same artwork, the results showed that people attributed lower sensitivity, lower ability to evoke their emotions, and lower quality to the artwork when they thought the artist was AI as compared to when they believed the artist was human. Experiment 2 reproduced these results and extended them to a slightly different setting, a different piece of (exclusively auditory) artwork, and added some additional measures.

6193,what does human consciousness mean?,Consciousness - a Dialogical Presentation,"Consciousness is, probably, the most common and the most mysterious experience in human life. It encompasses a stream of mental activities that include knowledge and recognition, emotions and feelings, organic dispositions, and linguistic acts, as well as altered states such as those provoked by drugs and pathologies, and mystical moments. The philosophy of mind is habitually reprimanded for neglecting to characterize exactly what consciousness is. In this regard there has been little change over the previous decades because consciousness has a wide assortment of meanings according to authors and disciplines. Consciousness is analysed in scientific perspectives such as neurosciences, psychology, linguistics, physics, and cybernetics. Each science highlights special features of consciousness’ rooting in the subject, according to specific interpersonal contexts, biological developments and always as a mirror of the brain's complexity. A short state of the art of consciousness’ studies is useful if it searches for constant issues beyond the variety of explorations of conscious experience. Beyond the psychology’s self, the psychoanalysis’ ego and the mental maps of neurosciences, we observe trends in the philosophy of mind that search for a dialogical ground; what relates us to the other as we say ‘I’, ‘Thou’ and ‘We’, is an essential aspect of human experience and a permanent challenge.","Consciousness is a complex experience that includes knowledge, emotions, and linguistic acts, and is rooted in the subject, interpersonal contexts, and the brain's complexity.",question,1406,175.0

This study contributes to the first-hand primary research on the topic exploring DBS clinicians’ views on post-DBS personality change among their patients and its underlying cause. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen clinicians from various disciplines working in Australian DBS practice for movement disorders and/or psychiatric conditions. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed five primary themes: 1) types, frequency and duration of personality change, 2) causes of personality change, 3) impact on patient and family, 4) communication, comprehension and awareness, and 5) management. Clinicians described a variety of personality changes in Parkinson’s disease following DBS including irritability, impulsivity and impaired decision-making. The frequency of personality change seen in patients varied amongst clinicians, but changes were overwhelmingly transient. Clinicians considered both DBS stimulation and additional factors (response to treatment, disease pathology, pharmacological changes) as inducing personality change. For DBS patients with major depressive disorder, a restoration of pre-morbid personality was associated with alleviation of illness. Considerations for future research of personality change following DBS include selecting suitable tools for quantitative examination and developing a common language between the scientific and ethics communities. Clinical implications including recommendations for the informed consent process for patients and families and clinicians’ management of personality change are discussed.","Clinicians described various personality changes in Parkinson's disease patients following DBS, but changes were overwhelmingly transient.",question,1832,138.0

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer-identified (LGBTQ) youth are a population with a unique set of service needs. Existing research on effective service methods with LGBTQ youth is limited. Youth empowerment holds potential as an approach that can impact well-being among youth who face discrimination. The current study explores the relationship between the social justice youth development framework (Ginwright and James, New Directions Youth Dev 96:27–46, 2002) and youth empowerment in a sample of LGBTQ youth. Multiple regression analysis of data collected through a community-based youth program identified critical consciousness and community engagement as significant predictors of empowerment.

In this technological era, digital games have proven their efficacy in promoting learners’ vocabulary acquisition. The current study investigates whether the integration of technology-driven digital games is effective in enhancing the vocabulary level by comparing experimental and control groups. The researcher conducted a pretest for the experimental group and a posttest for both groups within a period of five consecutive weeks. The experimental group used 7 Little Words, which is a game for learning vocabulary, whereas the participants in the control group learned vocabulary through traditional methods. The sample comprised 30 Arabic native speakers studying English as a required course in two all-male classes (15 students from each) in the third year of secondary school.

1150,the relation between coach leadership style and athlete satisfaction level,COACHING LEADERSHIP STYLES AND ATHLETE SATISFACTIONS AMONG HOCKEY TEAM,"Successful coaching is the ability to treat athletes respectfully. Athletes have varied talents and each deserves respect for his/her uniqueness. Coaches need to vary their style with every athlete. The same training program does not suit everybody. Each athlete needs to be motivated differently. Chelladurai’s Multidimensional Model of Leadership, which applies specifically to sport, recognizes the importance of leadership style: 1) actual leader behavior 2) leader behavior preferred by athlete and 3) required leader behavior. The degree of congruence among these three components determines athlete’s satisfaction and performance. A Revised Leadership Scale for Sport (RLSS), developed by Zhang, Jensen and Mann (1997); a scale that examines style of coaching behaviors; 1) autocratic, 2) democratic, 3) positive feedback, 4) training and instruction 5) social support and 6) situational consideration behaviors is also used. The items of the Athlete Satisfaction Questionnaire (Chelladurai & Riemer, 1997), addresses the most aspect of athlete participation: 1) performance 2) leadership 3) the team 4) the individual. The purpose of this paper is to identify: 1) style of leadership behaviors athletes prefer from their coaches 2) factors of athlete satisfaction in team sport and 3) relationship between leadership style of the coaches and athletes satisfaction. According to Brian Mackenzie (2003), coaches motivate the athlete wish and provide them effective training and improve athlete performance. Asiah and Rosli (2008), indicated that the athlete in sport teams are satisfied with their teammates sense of fair play, sportsmanlike behavior, teamwork and shared the same goals.

6032,what is the average overprescribed unconsumed opioid after cancer surgery,Standardizing Opioid Prescriptions to Patients After Ambulatory Oncologic Surgery Reduces Overprescription.,"BACKGROUND
Overprescribing of opioids after surgery contributes to long-term abuse. Evaluating opioid prescription patterns and patient-reported opioid use offers an evidence-based method to identify potential overprescription. This quality improvement initiative aimed to reduce and standardize opioid prescriptions upon discharge from an ambulatory oncologic surgery center and evaluate the effect of this change on patients' subsequent opioid use and reported pain.


METHODS
Between March 2018 and January 2019, consecutive opioid-naïve patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent robotic or laparoscopic hysterectomy, radical prostatectomy, or partial nephrectomy, or total mastectomy with or without immediate reconstruction were surveyed 7-10 days postoperatively. Data collected in the pre- (n = 551) and post-standardization (n = 480) cohorts included perception of pain relief, opioids prescribed (verified by electronic medical record review) and consumed, and refills received.


RESULTS
Pre-standardization, the median opioid prescription at discharge was 20 pills (interquartile range [IQR] 20-28) or 140 oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME) (IQR 100-150). Median opioid consumption was 2 pills (IQR 0-7) or 10 MME (IQR 0-40) among all services. Opioid prescriptions were later standardized to 7, 8, and 10 pills (35, 40, and 75 MME), in the gynecology, urology, and breast services, respectively. The change was not associated with an increase in reported pain. Refill requests increased postintervention across all surgeries from 4.4% to 7.7%, with the largest increase among patients who underwent breast surgery.


CONCLUSION
The number of opioid pills given at discharge to patients undergoing ambulatory or short-stay cancer surgery can safely be reduced.","Before standardization, the median opioid consumption was 2 pills (10 MME) after ambulatory oncologic surgery.",question,1775,110.0
3354,are there any workplace male stereotypes?,The glass ceiling in human resources: Exploring the link between women's representation in management and the practices of strategic human resource management and employee involvement,"Research on sex stereotypes suggests that gender bias is an invisible barrier—the so-called glass ceiling—preventing women from breaking into the highest levels of management in business organizations. Using data from a state-based professional HR organization, we investigated this phenomenon in the field of HR management. Building on the lack of fit model of gender discrimination and previous research, we tested two hypotheses: that women in HR are more likely to be concentrated in lower-level managerial positions in organizations that emphasize employee involvement (because of a related emphasis on stereotypically feminine managerial abilities) and that women in HR also are more likely to be concentrated in lower-level managerial positions in organizations that emphasize strategic human resource management (because of a related emphasis on stereotypically masculine characteristics). Our results support the first but not the second hypothesis.

The pathogenesis is still unknown. For this study, a three- dimensional bone model of the canine elbow was created and finite element analysis performed in order to determine the relationship between fracture type and bone interactions. Fused and non-fused humeral condyles were considered. A failure criterion was implemented to simulate the pathogenesis until fracture. Our study results confirm the clinical observation that lateral condylar fracture is the most common fracture type, implying interaction with the radius. Medial and Y-fractures are less common and occur always in interaction with the ulna whereas the radius causes lateral condylar fracture. Additionally, the fracture type is sensitive to bone positioning during trauma.

357,how do musicians incorporate their cultural traditions into cross-cultural music making?,Editorial,"Several of the articles in this issue raise interesting and important questions about the intercultural nature of music, though in rather different ways. These questions arise most directly and at a fairly elaborate theoretical level in the article by Graham Vulliamy and John Shepherd, but there are other possibly unintentional contributions from writers as diverse as Brian Loane, Felix Cross and Kevin Hamel. Music educators find themselves on very difficult ground when attempting to step outside the particular musical culture in which they happen to have been initiated. For most of us this is the older Western classical tradition, though for an increasing number there is now more involvement with music of the pop and rock traditions, with jazz or with other forms of contemporary music. If teachers choose to stay within the limitations of the music they understand they are, perhaps rightly, considered to be' ethnocentric', having little sympathy with the music of other cultures. If, on the other hand, teachers dare, however tentatively, to explore other musics (including the great wealth of the Afro-American traditions) then they become open to the charge that they misunderstand and misinterpret them. How can we respond to music originating in a social context of which we have no first-hand experience? Yet it seems obvious that we can and do respond to the music of other times and places. Indeed, in so responding we might argue that we better understand these cultures: and that to become involved in the music of a society is to gain insights into that society. It is also certain that people will inevitably re-interpret the music of other cultures to fit their own musical expectations. Thus, for example, we have hymns sung on South Pacific islands in quite a different way from that envisaged by missionaries from cities in England; we have Viennese masses in Brazil written by people who had never been to Europe, but who managed in an extraordinary way to adapt the styles to their own particular image of how music should be; we have references to medieval and Tudor traditions in the music of Steeleye Span. Such re-interpretations are the life-force of music as it changes and develops from time to time and place to place. Such a transformation is described in the article by Felix Cross. Here we notice the cross-influences of Africa and America on the music of Jamaica, or, more specifically, on reggae. We are also aware of the powerful influence that reggae has had on popular music in Europe during the last decade or so. In the article by Kevin Hamel attention is drawn to the fertile possi-","People inevitably re-interpret the music of other cultures to fit their own musical expectations, leading to cross-cultural influences and transformations in music.",question,2632,164.0

Their failure can be attributed to an institutional refusal to acknowledge teenagers as sexual beings, thus limiting the scope of sex education curricula. Abstinence-only approaches shame students into silence, and clarifying questions never get asked or answered, leaving sexually active students with little accurate knowledge.

Although adolescent girls with older male partners are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infection, the importance of this association in young adults is unclear. Goal: To assess the association between partner age difference and prevalence of chlamydial infection among young women. Study Design: Using Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (April 2, 2001–May 9, 2002), the authors examined the relation between the prevalence of chlamydial infection and the partner age among women aged 18 to 26 years. Results: Among women with most recent partners 2 to 8 years younger, the odds of chlamydial infection were approximately 2 times greater [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9, 3.5] than among women with partners within 1-year age difference, adjusting for number of partners in the past year. Prevalence of chlamydial infection was only slightly greater for women with partners 2 to 5 years older (adjusted OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9, 2.3) and partners 6 or more years older (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9, 2.8), when compared with women with partners within 1-year age difference. The relation between most discordant partner age difference and chlamydial infection seems to vary by women’s race/ethnicity, although these stratified estimates are imprecise.

Although cholesterol is the sole precursor of many steroid hormones required for the growth, development, and reproduction of mammals, the lethal effects of excess serum cholesterol have been well documented. Primary sources of cholesterol in foods are meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, and seafood. Food processing primarily causes changes in cholesterol content through moisture loss and oxidation. Cholesterol oxidation products, although occurring in minute amounts compared with cholesterol, may potentially pose greater risks to human health because of their toxicity. The determination of cholesterol is simpler than that of cholesterol oxides because cholesterol exists in a much greater concentration and less susceptible to further degradation during analytic procedures. Cholesterol and cholesterol oxides are primarily determined by gas chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with detection means from as simple as flame ionization or ultraviolet absorption to as complicated as electrochemistry or mass spectrometry.","Primary sources of cholesterol in foods are meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, and seafood, and food processing can cause changes in cholesterol content.",question,1173,146.0

In this paper, it is suggested that 'teacher centred teaching' should also have a major role to play, improving the quality of the learning experience in higher education. Students are extremely diverse in their skills, weaknesses, and learning styles, but lecturers are just as diverse in their abilities and areas of expertise. Moreover, teaching methods are now more varied than ever before (e.g. lectures, tutorials, workshops, labs, ebl/pbl, on-line provision, transferable skills exercises), often requiring specialist skills that not every university lecturer possesses. Identifying those strengths and weaknesses, and building our teaching around the qualities of our teachers, is surely one way of improving the student learning environment, and perhaps leading to happier students and more fulfilled lecturers.","Teacher-centered teaching can improve the quality of the learning experience in higher education, potentially leading to happier students and more fulfilled lecturers.",question,902,167.0
10877,advantages to sleeping with the lights on,Biodynamic lighting effects on the sleep pattern of people with dementia,"Abstract Dementia can disturb the circadian rhythm more than in normal ageing people. And their biological clock is often not enough stimulated by light. Sleep disturbances form a high burden for informal caregivers and is the main reason for institutionalization. The effect of biodynamic lighting with varying intensity and colour resembling a daylight curve has hardly been objectively researched. In this study, we evaluate the exposure to biodynamic lighting on circadian functioning of 13 patients with dementia admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Three biodynamic lighting armatures designed for home use were placed in the common area for a period of three weeks and then removed for the same period. These periods were intermittent in an AB-phase design. Objective data of the sleeping pattern were collected using a bed sensor. During exposure the average frequency of night-time bed wandering significantly decreased from 11 to 5 times (P = 0.002). The average frequency of daytime napping significantly decreased from 16 to 7 times (P = 0.004). The average total night-time sleep significantly increased from 408 to 495 min (P = 0.007).

22379,do high expectations lead to better results?,Success Expectations and Performance: Regulatory Focus as a Moderator,"According to classic psychological theories of motivation, success expectations induce high motivation and thus lead to high performance. However, recent researchers have found that people sometimes select subjectively worse performance goals, thus lowering their expectations so as to avoid future mistakes and regret. Therefore, our research was directed to answer the ""when"" and ""how"" questions?when are the classic relationships (i.e., the positive correlations between expectations and performance) most likely to occur and what self-regulatory principles underlie their occurrence. Applying regulatory focus theory, we hypothesized that regulatory focus moderated the relations between expectations and performance and that motivation served as a mediator and partially explained the mechanism. These hypotheses were tested through two studies, both of which used the game ""Spot the Differences"" as experimental materials and recruited undergraduate students as participants. Study 1 measured the level of expectations and manipulated temporary regulatory focus with task framing techniques. Study 2 measured individual chronic regulatory focus with Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ) to further test the moderating effects. In addition, considering that Study 1 didn’t support the main effects of expectations as presented in classic motivational theories, Study 2 applied within-subject experimental design and manipulated expectations through the difficulty of tasks. Motivations were manipulated as the time participants spent on the tasks in both studies, and their mediating effects were tested according to the procedures proposed by Muller, Judd, Yzerbyt (2005). The findings showed that: ①Regulatory focus moderated the relationship between expectations and performance. For promotion focus individuals, success expectations correlated positively with performance, which was consistent with classic motivational theories; For prevention focus individuals, the correlation was not significant. ②Motivation mediated the interactions—high success expectations raised the motivational strength of promotion focus individuals, thus resulting in enhanced performance; while it made no significant motivational impacts on prevention focus individuals. The present research deepens our understanding of the relationship between expectations and performance by considering regulatory focus as both a situational factor and s chronic individual difference. Furthermore, it extends the moderating effect of regulatory focus from realistic outcomes to outcome expectations. It also suggests that positive beliefs about further (e.g., high success expectations) do not always lead to positive outcomes, which may depend on their relationships with individual properties and situational requirement.","For promotion-focused individuals, high success expectations correlate positively with performance, while for prevention-focused individuals, the correlation is not significant.",question,2802,177.0
14818,does climate change effect global governance,The Process and Impact of Global Climate Governance: A Case Study of the Paris Climate Agreement,"Global climate governance is a global public good, which has received more and more attention in recent years. Climate governance has three characteristics: multi-level, political and lagging. The paper examines the development process of global climate governance and its existing defects, and analyses the impact of the Paris Agreement on global climate governance. Since the entry into force of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, several legal documents have been issued in phases, of which the Paris Agreement is the first major achievement of international climate governance. Although the Paris Agreement adopts the obvious weakness of the model in which the member nations determine their own contribution, it is also a very useful attempt. The effectiveness of the Paris Agreement still depends on the independent contributions of various countries. Therefore, in climate governance, it is necessary to lead countries to actively fulfil their obligations.","The Paris Agreement is the first major achievement of international climate governance, and its effectiveness depends on the independent contributions of various countries.",question,992,172.0

Initially (1962-1973) social life was established through land appropriation and simultaneous creation of their own community organizations. Subsequently, the pobladores had to defend their way of life against the military government (1973-1986), by means that were at once specifically concrete and spiritual. At length, when the military government began to make way for a civil regime, the pobladores had to define or redefine the meaning that lay in those quarters (1986-1992).

20419,the impact of interprofessional collaborative practice among post-acute stroke survivors,Enablers and barriers in hospital-to-home transitional care for stroke survivors and caregivers: A systematic review.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To synthesise qualitative research evidence on the experience of stroke survivors and informal caregivers in hospital-to-home transitional care.


BACKGROUND
Due to a shortened hospital stay, stroke survivors/caregivers must take over complex care on discharge from hospital to home. Gaps in the literature warrant a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies on perceived enablers and barriers during this crucial period.


DESIGN
A systematic review and meta-synthesis.


METHODS
A review was guided by Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) checklist where six databases were searched from April to June 2020 including CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. There was no date limit to the search. Selected studies were critically appraised. A thematic synthesis approach was applied.


RESULTS
The synthesis of 29 studies identified three major findings. First, partnerships with stroke survivors/caregivers empower discharge preparation, foster competence to navigate health and social care systems and activate self-management capabilities. Second, gaps in discharge planning and the lack of timely postdischarge support contribute to unmet care needs for stroke survivors/caregivers and affect their ability to cope with poststroke changes. Third, stroke survivors/caregivers expect integrated transitional care that promotes shared decision-making and enables long-term self-management at home.


CONCLUSIONS
Hospital-to-home transition is a challenging period in the trajectory of poststroke rehabilitation and recovery. Further research is required to deepen understandings of all stakeholders' views and address unmet needs during transitional care.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Protocols and clinical guidelines relating to discharge planning and transitional care need to be reviewed to ensure partnership approach with survivors/caregivers in the design and delivery of individualised transitional care. Stroke nurses are in a unique position to lead timely support for survivors/caregivers and to bridge service gaps in hospital-to-home transitional care.",Partnerships with stroke survivors/caregivers empower discharge preparation and enable long-term self-management at home.,phrase,2200,121.0
16570,the impact of non-governmental organizations' activties on rural livelihood,"IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY NON-STATE ACTORS ON RURAL LIVELIHOODS: A CASE OF DISTRICT MANSEHRA, KHYBER PUKHTUNKHWA, PAKISTAN","The failure of state actors/institutions in the country in delivering agricultural advisory and extension services to the rural community created a space for non-state actors to deliver these services at the door steps of majority of the rural poor people in order to improve their livelihoods. This situation prevails in all the four provinces of the country especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where rural poverty is evident. In order to access the impact of agricultural services rendered by different non-state institutions on the livelihoods of rural poor in this region, the current research study was designed. The study was conducted in district Mansehra (one of the most populated district of Hazara division). Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used for the collection of data from respondents. The data were collected from the rural community of those villages where the selected non-state organizations were involved in a variety of rural development related activities/tasks. The data were collected from 450 respondents randomly selected from 6 villages. The collected data were analyzed by using computer based statistical software – SPSS. From the results it was concluded that majority of the respondents had age between 36-50 years with secondary educational level. The land holding size of the respondents in the research was very small. It was also concluded that a large majority (>80.0%) of respondents said that agricultural services rendered by non-state institutions like extension education, trainings related to crop & livestock management, poultry & forestry services, vaccination for livestock and awareness campaigns regarding latest agricultural technologies improved their overall agricultural productivity as well as livelihoods. It was also concluded that regarding impacts of agricultural services rendered by non-state organizations, a large majority of the respondents (89.6%) said that their agricultural services increased their agricultural productivity. While exploring the reasons due to which agricultural related services of non-state organizations play role in improving livelihoods of rural people, the results of the study indicated that in extension and education services majority (54.6%) of the respondents said that social organizations provided good quality extension and education related services to the rural community. Finally, it was concluded that agricultural services of non-state organizations were very effective and played a significant role in upgrading the livelihoods of rural poor.","Agricultural services provided by non-state institutions, such as extension education and trainings, improved overall agricultural productivity and livelihoods for over 80% of respondents in rural Pakistan.",phrase,2570,206.0

2142,does crossfit increase injury risk?,Prediction of Injuries in CrossFit Training: A Machine Learning Perspective,"CrossFit has gained recognition and interest among physically active populations being one of the most popular and rapidly growing exercise regimens worldwide. Due to the intense and repetitive nature of CrossFit, concerns have been raised over the potential injury risks that are associated with its training including rhabdomyolysis and musculoskeletal injuries. However, identification of risk factors for predicting injuries in CrossFit athletes has been limited by the absence of relevant big epidemiological studies. The main purpose of this paper is the identification of risk factors and the development of machine learning-based models using ensemble learning that can predict CrossFit injuries. To accomplish the aforementioned targets, a survey-based epidemiological study was conducted in Greece to collect data on musculoskeletal injuries in CrossFit practitioners. A Machine Learning (ML) pipeline was then implemented that involved data pre-processing, feature selection and well-known ML models. The performance of the proposed ML models was assessed using a comprehensive cross validation mechanism whereas a discussion on the nature of the selected features is also provided. An area under the curve (AUC) of 77.93% was achieved by the best ML model using ensemble learning (Adaboost) on the group of six selected risk factors. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated in a comparative analysis with respect to numerous performance metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC and confusion matrices to confirm its clinical relevance. The results are the basis for the development of reliable tools for the prediction of injuries in CrossFit.",The best ML model identified six risk factors and achieved a 77.93% AUC in predicting CrossFit injuries.,question,1689,104.0

22981,can the crowd solve problems?,Answering Planning Queries with the Crowd,"Recent research has shown that crowd sourcing can be used effectively to solve problems that are difficult for computers, e.g., optical character recognition and identification of the structural configuration of natural proteins. In this paper we propose to use the power of the crowd to address yet another difficult problem that frequently occurs in a daily life - answering planning queries whose output is a sequence of objects/actions, when the goal, i.e, the notion of ""best output"", is hard to formalize. For example, planning the sequence of places/attractions to visit in the course of a vacation, where the goal is to enjoy the resulting vacation the most, or planning the sequence of courses to take in an academic schedule planning, where the goal is to obtain solid knowledge of a given subject domain. Such goals may be easily understandable by humans, but hard or even impossible to formalize for a computer. 
 
We present a novel algorithm for efficiently harnessing the crowd to assist in answering such planning queries. The algorithm builds the desired plans incrementally, choosing at each step the 'best' questions so that the overall number of questions that need to be asked is minimized. We prove the algorithm to be optimal within its class and demonstrate experimentally its effectiveness and efficiency.","Crowdsourcing can effectively solve planning queries with hard-to-formalize goals, such as vacation planning or academic scheduling.",question,1330,132.0
19347,what are montessori teaching methods in early childhood?,Pretend Play and Fantasy: What if Montessori Was Right?,"Pretend play and fantasy are staples of childhood, supported by adults’ provision of encouraging tools (like dress-up clothing and play kitchens) and by media. Decades ago, Maria Montessori developed a system of education based on close observation of children, and she concluded that pretend play and fantasy were not as helpful for children’s development as the zeitgeist suggested (and still suggests). In this article, we present her views and relevant evidence, and ask: What if she was right? What if, as a culture, we are putting great effort and faith into activities and contexts for children that we believe help development but that might actually be less helpful than engaging in the real world? KEYWORDS—pretend play; fantasy; Montessori The subset of play activities we call pretend play are a signature of the preschool years. Such play occurs when one intentionally projects a mental representation onto reality in a spirit of fun (Lillard, 2015). During their second year, children around the world begin to use objects as other objects (Roopnarine, 2011). In the following years, they begin to use imaginary objects and project mental representations of different people onto themselves and their playmates, acting out scenes in sociodramatic play. Children everywhere pretend to do the activities they see adults doing (Gaskins, 2013; Lancy, 2016), and in some cultures, encouraged at times by media, they also pretend to be fantastical beings or superheroes (Haight, Wang, Fung, Williams, & Mintz, 1999). A common view is that pretend play (whether fantastical or replicative) is essential to healthy development, engendering other positive developments such as creativity and intelligence (Ginsburg, 2007; Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, Berk, & Singer, 2009; Paley, 2005). However, evidence for this idea is problematic (Lillard et al., 2013), and anthropologists often balk at the concept because in many cultures, pretend play is far less common, yet children everywhere become competent adults (Gaskins, 2013; Lancy, 1996; Parmar, Harkness, & Super, 2004; Singer, Singer, D ıAgostino, & Delong, 2009; Tudge, Brown, & Freitas, 2011). In many cultures, children as young as 4–6 years care for younger siblings, tend herds in remote pastures, prepare family meals, and help run shops. Unlike parents in the United States, parents in many other cultures neither encourage pretending with toys nor instigate and engage in pretending with their children (Roopnarine, 2011). Instead, children are more likely to engage in activities with real objects and people (Tudge et al., 2011). Reflecting local adult values, traditional Western preschools typically provide many toys to encourage pretend play, such as doll houses and kitchen props (Krafft & Berk, 1998), as do alternative schools like Reggio Emilia and Waldorf/Steiner (Edwards, 2002; Kirkham & Kidd, 2015). They also support fantasy, and their instructors read more fictional than informational materials to children (Kotaman & Tekin, 2017; Pentimonti, Zucker, & Justice, 2011). Montessori schools are an exception: They do not have pretend play or fantasy materials, and they have been criticized for these omissions (Kirkham & Kidd, 2015; Soundy, 2009). Angeline S.

3665,influence of acute stress on inhibitory control,Cognitive control and network disruption in remitted depression: a correlate of childhood adversity,"Abstract Individuals in a major depressive episode often display impairment in cognitive control, and this impairment exists outside of the acute phase of illness. Impairment in cognitive control also has been associated with exposure to childhood adversity (CA). The current study examined whether exposure to CA can explain variance in a component of cognitive control—inhibitory control—independent of diagnostic status in young adults with and without a history of depression. Healthy control individuals (n = 40) and individuals with remitted major depressive disorder (n = 53) completed a task measuring inhibitory control, reported level of CA and completed a scanning session to assess gray matter volume and resting state connectivity in regions associated with cognitive control. The results demonstrate that higher levels of CA were associated with poorer inhibitory control, reduced right middle frontal gyrus gray matter, decreased connectivity of salience and emotion networks and increased connectivity in cognitive control networks, even after controlling for diagnostic status, residual depression symptoms and current stressors. Together, the results suggest that inhibitory control impairment and intrinsic connectivity changes may be characterized as developmental sequelae of early stress exposure.","Higher levels of childhood adversity are associated with poorer inhibitory control, regardless of diagnostic status.",phrase,1319,116.0

We find that both permanent income and wealth are better predictors of life satisfaction than current income and wealth. They matter not only in absolute terms but also in comparative terms. However, their relative impacts differ. The first exerts a comparison effect—the higher the permanent income of the reference group, the lower life satisfaction—the second exerts an information effect—the higher the permanent wealth of the reference group, the higher life satisfaction. We also show that negative transitory shocks to income reduce life satisfaction while transitory shocks to wealth have no effect. Lastly, we analyse the effects of their components and find that not all of them predict life satisfaction: permanent taxes do not matter, while only the value of permanent real estate, financial and business assets do. Finally, we use quantile regression and analyse to what extent our results vary along the well-being distribution, finding the impacts to be larger at lower levels of life satisfaction.","Permanent income and wealth are better predictors of life satisfaction than current income and wealth, with their impacts varying along the well-being distribution.",question,1078,164.0

Stone formation is highly prevalent, with rates of up to 14.8% and increasing, and a recurrence rate of up to 50% within the first 5 years of the initial stone incident. The formation of the stone is a complex process which results from numerous physiochemical events such as, super saturation, nucleation, growth, aggregation, and retention of urinary stone constituents within tubular cells. Several therapies are being performed for kidney stone treatment, including thiazide diuretics, allopurinol, painkillers, dietary changes, shock-wave treatment, ureterenooscopic and percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and ureterenooscopic and percutaneous nephrolithotomy in severe cases.

Extensive ice crystal formation was found in platelets frozen in the absence of cryoprotective agents. Platelet preservation was much improved by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, or dimethyl acetamide, with glucose or 0.25 M sodium glycerophosphate, to platelet-rich plasma prior to the freeze drying process. Platelet membranes and organelles were generally well preserved, and many granules demonstrated eccentric areas of electron density. Microtubules were not clearly identified, but some platelets showed tubule-like structures within platelet hyaloplasm. Pseudopods were often observed at the platelet surface, and often contained membrane-bound granule-like structures. Some pseudopods contained electrondense material which extended between adjacent platelets in interplatelet bridges and which was released to the surrounding medium. Interplatelet bridge formation was not prevented by chelation of calcium by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that contractile protein is present in interplatelet bridges and serves as a basis for clot retraction.",Freeze-dried human platelets preservation was improved by adding dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl acetamide with glucose or sodium glycerophosphate before the freeze-drying process.,question,1202,179.0

In its discussion of how decolonial non-Western IR theory is, the article argues that while some perspectives within the subfield openly reject or simply ignore the concerns raised by decolonial thought, others put forward intellectual projects where decolonial arguments resonate. Hence, rather than characterizing the subfield in general terms, the article distinguishes those perspectives that are attentive to the need of generating a true dialog among knowledges and, by so doing, it contributes to critical scholarship within international relations.",Decolonial non-Western IR theory contributes to international relations by generating a true dialogue among knowledges and promoting critical scholarship.,question,1334,154.0

Internal factors in this research is a factor that can be used to learn. Meanwhile, the external factor of the adolescent involved is the factor of the family in the form of parenting style that implements the parents. This study aims to analyze the nurturing style, motivation, and strategies in learning against adolescent achievement. The data were collected using a questionnaire technique involving 149 VIII students from two State Junior High Schools in Bogor. The results found that about nine of the adolescents perceived the authoritative parenting style (89,3%). The results of the study also found that more than half of adolescents had moderate motivation categories (53,0%) with broader motivation. Seven of the adolescents had a low learning strategy (72,3%) and a fairly well-done dimension was the regulatory effort. The academic achievement of adolescents is almost entirely (95,3%) is categorized well.

We present two hypotheses after reviewing series of policy documents and related organizational adjustment descriptions. First, we argue that China's pro-liberal reform in trade and FDI institutions helped trade to take off. Second, China is ambitious in acquiring advanced technology and building up a sophisticated system to promote technological capability. An analysis of Grubel and Lloyd IIT index on intermediate goods trade belonging to SITC 7 and SITC 8- the key components of regional value chain in East Asia- suggests that the structural changes taking place in China's intermediate goods trade are in agreement with the stated hypotheses.

16551,what is the vision transformer?,"How to train your ViT? Data, Augmentation, and Regularization in Vision Transformers","Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive performance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image classification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison to convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer’s weaker inductive bias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization or data augmentation (“AugReg” for short) when training on smaller training datasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand the interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and compute budget. 1 As one result of this study we find that the combination of increased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as models trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models of various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or outperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available JFT-300M dataset.","Vision Transformers (ViT) are models that attain competitive performance in various vision applications like image classification, object detection, and semantic image segmentation.",question,1007,181.0
8513,Does CrossFit increase injury risk?,"CrossFit® – Development, Benefits and Risks","
 CrossFit is a form of high-intensity interval training and comparable to other high-intensity exercises. CrossFit exercises increase VO2max, strength, endurance, and improves the body composition (e. g. lean body mass).
 The injury risk in CrossFit is similar to that of other, comparable sports such as Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting and gymnastics and lower than that of competitive contact sports such as rugby union and rugby league. Shoulder joint, shoulder girdle and spine injuries are predominating in CrossFit and require special attention from physicians and coaches. In particular, this includes expert instruction for CrossFit beginners as well as an initial orthopedic examination before starting CrossFit training. The involvement of well-educated coaches correlates with a decreased injury rate. For this reason, it is recommended that beginners complete a special program with slow load increase and instructions of the fundamental CrossFit techniques. In CrossFit, previous injuries also increase the risk of re-injury, which is consistent with the findings of other sport-related injury studies, and should also be taken into account.

2438,does private equity funds shifted their investments in the energy sector?,Oil Price Movements and Risks of Energy Investments,"This article examines the historical relation between oil price movements and both public and private equity investments in the energy sector. By utilizing two proprietary private equity databases (one at the fund level and the other at the company level), the authors are able to show that investments in energy-focused private equity offer diversification benefits relative to similarly focused public equity and direct energy commodity investments. They find that public equity investments perform better than direct investments in energy commodities. Energy-focused private equity outperforms energy-focused public equity. A nonlinear relationship between the returns on energy-focused equity investments (both public and private) and energy prices over multiyear investment periods suggests that equity investments may capture more upside exposure to energy prices over sufficiently long holding periods. This effect, which may be related to the real and financial options embedded in equities, appears stronger for private equity. The authors conclude that investors with a liquidity preference would have favored energy-focused public equities to direct energy commodity investments. Investors willing to tolerate lower liquidity and preferring greater diversification would have benefited from allocating disproportionately to energy-focused private equity.",Energy-focused private equity outperforms energy-focused public equity and offers diversification benefits relative to public equity and direct energy commodity investments.,question,1365,173.0

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of diabetes with increasing severity of obesity and the distribution of HbA1c levels in diabetics participating in the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).MethodsData from a representative sample of adults with diabetes participating in the NHANES between 1999 and 2006 were reviewed. The prevalence of diabetes and levels of fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and HbA1c were examined across different weight classes with normal weight, overweight, and obesity classes 1, 2, and 3 were defined as body mass index (BMI) of <25.0, 25.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, 35.0–39.9, and equal to 40.0, respectively. The distribution of HbA1c levels among adults with diabetes was also examined.ResultsThere were 2,894 adults with diabetes (13.6%) among the 21,205 surveyed participants. Among the adults with diabetes, the mean age was 59 years, the mean fasting glucose was 155 ± 2 mg/dl, and the mean HbA1c was 7.2%; 80.3% of diabetics were considered overweight (BMI ≥ 25) and 49.1% of diabetics were considered obese (BMI ≥ 30). The prevalence of adults with diabetes increased with increasing weight classes, from 8% for normal weight individuals to 43% for individuals with obesity class 3; the distribution of HbA1c levels were considered as good (<7.0%) in 60%, fair (7.0–8.0%) in 17%, and poor (>8.0%) in 23%. The mean fasting glucose and HbA1c levels were highest for diabetics with BMI <25.0, suggesting a state of higher severity of disease. Mean insulin and c-peptide levels were highest for diabetics with BMI = 35.0, suggesting a state of insulin resistance.ConclusionsIn a nationally representative sample of US adults, the prevalence of diabetes increases with increasing weight classes.

15309,which toothbrush is good manual or powered?,Six-month comparison of powered versus manual toothbrushing for safety and efficacy in the absence of professional instruction in mechanical plaque control.,"BACKGROUND
Reports suggest powered toothbrushing may provide some clinical benefit over manual tooth-brushing, but most studies have been of short duration with subjects trained in toothbrush use. The aim was to determine if the oscillating-rotating powered brush (PB) could safely provide clinical benefits over and above a manual brush (M) in subjects with no formal instruction or experience in powered brush use.


METHODS
This 6-month, single-masked, parallel design, randomized clinical trial compared the PB with an American Dental Association (ADA)-accepted soft-bristle manual brush in a non-flossing gingivitis population (n = 157). Subjects were given written instructions but no demonstration on toothbrush use at baseline. Efficacy was assessed by changes in gingival inflammation, plaque, calculus, and stain, while changes in clinical attachment levels and recession measurements provided safety data. A prophylaxis was provided after baseline assessment. The 6-month plaque index (PI) was recorded immediately post-brushing after covert timing of the subjects, and correlation analyses were run to assess the relationship of brushing time to PI. Paired t tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to assess within and between treatment group differences for PB (n = 76) versus M groups (n = 81).


RESULTS
Measures of inflammation showed a statistically significant drop for both brushes at 3 and 6 months. Mean overnight full-mouth PI scores were significantly lower at 3 months for the PB (1.57) compared to the M group (1.80), P = 0.0013. Immediate post-brushing PI at 6 months was also significantly lower for the PB (1.10) versus M (1.39) (P= 0.0025). There was an overall negative correlation for PI and brushing time (r = -0.377, P= 0.0001). Mean calculus index (CI) scores were lower for the PB at 3 (P= 0.0304) and 6 months (P = 0.0078), while no significant differences in stain were observable. Clinical attachment level and recession measurements showed no significant between-group changes from baseline for either brush on canine teeth or on teeth with recession at baseline.


CONCLUSION
The oscillating-rotating toothbrush safely provides clinical benefits in plaque and calculus reduction over a manual brush even in subjects with no formal oral hygiene instruction.",The oscillating-rotating toothbrush provides clinical benefits in plaque and calculus reduction over a manual brush even without formal oral hygiene instruction.,question,2340,161.0

We do this using data from 9,835 football (soccer) matches, comparing matches played behind closed doors because of the COVID-19 pandemic with those played before a crowd. We find that home advantage in terms of in-play decisions by match officials is significantly reduced in the absence of crowds. Examining the decisions of football referees, we find that away teams receive fewer yellow and red cards when playing in an empty stadium compared to matches with a crowd. This suggests the decisions of officials are influenced by the social pressure on match officials of a crowd, and that forecasts of match-related events and outcomes should be adjusted accordingly.",Home advantage in terms of in-play decisions by match officials is significantly reduced in the absence of crowds.,question,786,114.0

7945,benefits of traditional advertising,Competitive Poaching in Sponsored Search Advertising and Its Strategic Impact on Traditional Advertising,"Traditional advertising, such as TV and print advertising, primarily builds awareness of a firm's product among consumers. On the other hand, sponsored search advertising can target consumers in a later stage of the purchase process because they self-identify themselves by searching for a relevant keyword on a search engine. The ability to target these consumers who are closer to making a purchase induces competitors to ""poach"" these consumers by directly advertising on the firm's keywords. Using a game theory model, we study how competing firms should allocate their advertising budgets, and how a search engine should design the sponsored search position auction for deciding the order in which advertisers are displayed. We find that symmetric firms may follow asymmetric advertising strategies, with one firm focusing on traditional advertising and the other firm focusing on sponsored search with poaching. Interestingly, the search engine benefits from handicapping poaching, i.e., it benefits from discouraging competition in its own auctions. This explains why search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing use ""keyword relevance"" scores to under-weight the bids of firms bidding on competitors' keywords. We also obtain various other interesting insights on the interplay between sponsored search advertising and traditional advertising.","Traditional advertising builds awareness, sponsored search advertising targets consumers closer to purchase and discourages competition.",phrase,1353,136.0

Vocational training may be the best chance to help unemployed young people at the bottom of the income distribution. This paper evaluates the impact of a randomized training program for disadvantaged youth introduced in Colombia in 2005 on the employment and earnings of trainees. This is one of a couple of randomized training trials conducted in developing countries and, thus, offers a unique opportunity to examine the causal impact of training in a developing country context. We use originally collected data on individuals randomly offered and not offered training. We find that the program raises earnings and employment for both men and women, with larger effects on women. Women offered training earn about 18% more than those not offered training, while men offered training earn about 8% more than men not offered training. Much of the earnings increases for both men and women are related to increased employment in formal sector jobs following training. The benefits of training are greater when individuals spend more time doing on-the-job training, while hours of training in the classroom have no impact on the returns to training.

2696,what supplements can improve health in breastfeeding women?,"Evaluation of breastfeeding promotion, support, and knowledge of benefits on breastfeeding outcomes","We examined how prenatal exposure to breastfeeding information from various media sources, maternal knowledge of benefits, family and clinician support, and peer practices influence breastfeeding outcomes in early infancy. Initiation of breastfeeding, any breastfeeding at two months, and exclusivity of breastfeeding at two months were examined in a cohort of US women using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analyses and logistic regression were conducted. Approximately 85 percent of the women initiated breastfeeding. At two months, 63.8 percent continued breastfeeding, while only 38.1 percent breastfed exclusively. Mothers with greater knowledge about breastfeeding benefits were 11.2 (95% CI: 6.87–18.45) times more likely to initiate breastfeeding and 5.62 (95% CI: 4.19–7.54) times more likely to breastfeed at two months than those with lower levels of knowledge. Women whose families prenatally supported exclusive breastfeeding were 8.21(5.12–13.2) times more likely to initiate and continue breastfeeding (OR 3.21, 95% CI: 2.51–4.11). Clinicians who supported breastfeeding only also increased the odds of a woman initiating breastfeeding (OR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.31–2.88). Interventions to increase maternal knowledge of breastfeeding benefits and family and clinician support of breastfeeding in the prenatal period may help increase breastfeeding rates.

4700,Does exercise increase depression?,Treating depression with exercise: the inflammasome inhibition perspective,"Patients with chronic inflammation present increased blood levels of circulating cytokines and often are associated with symptoms of depression. The activation of the immune cells microglia in the brain of depressed patients has been associated with a greater prevalence of suicide, indicating a crucial role of neuroinflammation in the neuropathology of depression. In the modern lifestyle, decreased physical activity and increased sedentarism have emerged as risk factors for mental disorders, including depression. The literature is very consistent that exercise is an antidepressant; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects are far from being completely defined.

15967,russia-ukraine war cause inflation?,War in Ukraine: challenges for the global economy,"Introduction. As the attack on Ukraine intensified, the United States and other Western countries imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia and declared their support for Ukraine. Problem. Consideringthe far-reaching impact of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine on international development in the long run, it is extremely important for the international community to implement compre­hensive solutions focused on development priorities. The aim of the article is to study the impact of the war in Ukraine on inflation risks and challenges for the world economy. Methods. The information base of the study was the study of official information and periodicals. Methodological basis of the research: analysis, synthesis, systems approach, statistical methods and abstract-logical methods. Results. The new sanctions regime and the cost of the war are likely to push the Russian economy into a recession worse than the 1998 recession and the Russian financial crisis, accompanied by significant increases in inflation and the cost of living of Russian households. According to our preliminary estimates, Russia’s real GDP will fall by 4–9 % in 2022, while growth will range from –1 % to 2.5 % in 2023. Inflation may rise to 11–17 % in 2022, fall to 6–12.03 % in 2022. A key factor in these projections is that Russia’s oil and gas exports, especially to Europe, are largely continuing, but this may change if sanctions are tightened. In 2021, Russia’s exports of mineral fuels, oils and distillation products amounted to 199 USDbillion. USA, which accounts for 40.5 % of Russia’s total exports and 11.4 % of its GDP. Depending on the duration of sanctions and the possibility of their strengthening, the world economy may be significantly affected during 2022–2023. Conclusions. It is expected that the war in Ukraine will have a significant impact on the economy and consumers in terms of such actions: expanding the supply chain, increasing inflationary pressures, deteriorating economic prospects.",The war in Ukraine is expected to increase inflationary pressures and deteriorate economic prospects worldwide.,phrase,2008,111.0
21324,does coffee in the morning raise cortisol levels,Stress-like adrenocorticotropin responses to caffeine in young healthy men,"The effects of oral caffeine (3.3 mg/kg, equivalent to 2-3 cups of coffee) on plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) were tested in 47 healthy young men at rest in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Following caffeine, ACTH was significantly elevated at all times from 30 min to 180 min, and CORT was elevated from 60 min to 120 min (Fs > or = 8.4, ps < 0.01). Peak increases relative to placebo were: ACTH, 33% (+5.2 pg/ml) and CORT, 30% (+2.7 micrograms/dl) at 60 min postcaffeine. The results suggest that caffeine can activate important components of the pituitary-adrenocortical response in humans during the resting state.

13765,How if inflation affected by forgein trade?,Economic Exchange During Hyperinflation,"Historical evidence indicates that hyperinflations can disrupt individuals' normal trading patterns and impede the orderly functioning of markets. To explore these issues, we construct a theoretical model of hyperinflation that focuses on individuals and their process of economic exchange. In our model buyers must carry cash while shopping, and some transactions take place in a decentralized setting in which buyer and seller negotiate over the terms of trade of an indivisible good. Since buyers face the constant threat of incoming younger (hence richer) customers, their bargaining position is weakened by inflation, allowing sellers to extract a higher real price. However, we show that higher inflation also reduces buyers' search, increasing sellers' wait for customers. As a result, the volume of transactions concluded in the decentralized sector falls. At high enough rates of inflation, all agents suffer a welfare loss.","Hyperinflation weakens buyers' bargaining position, allowing sellers to extract higher real prices, but also reduces buyers' search, leading to a decrease in transaction volume.",question,933,177.0

The present study reviews the field of disclosure and examines factors affecting disclosure among a service population of abused children who were placed in residential care due to various forms of abuse (e.g., physical, sexual, emotional, neglect and witnessing domestic violence). The sample consisted of 286 Israeli (Hebrew and Arabic speaking) children aged 12-17 (mean=14±1). Following approval of the Ethics committee of the University and parents' written consent, participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that included the following measures: a Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), and the Disclosure of Trauma Questionnaire (DTQ). Results indicated that the three key factors enhancing the likelihood of disclosure were: moral factors, external initiatives and intolerable physical pain. The three key factors inhibiting disclosure were feelings of shame, fear of losing social support and uncertainty as to how and to whom to disclose. Results also showed that children preferred to disclose to their nuclear family members (parents and siblings) in comparison with professionals.","Three key factors enhancing disclosure in children of trauma survivors are moral factors, external initiatives, and intolerable physical pain.",question,1342,142.0

20008,what is the association between income and dementia,The economic burden of dementia in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): a systematic review,"Introduction More than two-thirds of people with dementia live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), resulting in a significant economic burden in these settings. In this systematic review, we consolidate the existing evidence on the cost of dementia in LMICs. Methods Six databases were searched for original research reporting on the costs associated with all-cause dementia or its subtypes in LMICs. The national-level dementia costs inflated to 2019 were expressed as percentages of each country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and summarised as the total mean percentage of GDP. The risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Larg and Moss method. Results We identified 14 095 articles, of which 24 studies met the eligibility criteria. Most studies had a low risk of bias. Of the 138 LMICs, data were available from 122 countries. The total annual absolute per capita cost ranged from US$590.78 for mild dementia to US$25 510.66 for severe dementia. Costs increased with the severity of dementia and the number of comorbidities. The estimated annual total national costs of dementia ranged from US$1.04 million in Vanuatu to US$195 billion in China. The average total national expenditure on dementia estimated as a proportion of GDP in LMICs was 0.45%. Indirect costs, on average, accounted for 58% of the total cost of dementia, while direct costs contributed 42%. Lack of nationally representative samples, variation in cost components, and quantification of indirect cost were the major methodological challenges identified in the existing studies. Conclusion The estimated costs of dementia in LMICs are lower than in high-income countries. Indirect costs contribute the most to the LMIC cost. Early detection of dementia and management of comorbidities is essential for reducing costs. The current costs are likely to be an underestimation due to limited dementia costing studies conducted in LMICs, especially in countries defined as low- income. PROSPERO registration number The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database with registration number CRD42020191321.","The total annual per capita cost of dementia in low- and middle-income countries ranges from $590.78 for mild dementia to $25,510.66 for severe dementia, with costs increasing with severity and comorbidities.",question,2140,208.0
23165,does universal pre-k make for worse outcomes?,"Universal Prekindergarten, Fertility, and Maternal Health: A Difference-in-Regression-Discontinuities Design with Extrapolations","Prior research suggests that high quality prekindergarten (pre-K) programs can promote school readiness and generate lifetime benefits for children. However, very little is known about how pre-K programs affect other family members. In this study, I examine the effects of the New York City pre-K program on the health of low-income mothers, their healthcare utilization, fertility, and well-being, by linking Medicaid data to 2014 program participants, the year the universal pre-K program was launched in NYC. I use a difference-in-regression-discontinuities design that exploits both the introduction of universal pre-K and the birthdate cutoff for enrollment, in order to address potential bias from the steep development trajectory found in even small age ranges in early childhood, as well as potential preexisting confounding policies that use the same age cutoff to determine eligibility. I find no significant effects from having a child who was born just inside the eligibility cutoff, versus a child who was born just outside the eligibility cutoff, except a small negative effect on the likelihood of prescriptions for those without younger children. In addition, I extend the regression discontinuity design extrapolation methods, based on local derivatives and matching on observables, to the difference-in-regression-discontinuities framework, in order to estimate the average effects on the entire pre-K and non-pre-K population, a year on either side of the cutoff date. The extrapolation results differ little from those at the cutoff. Additional extrapolations done in small age ranges indicate that the effects of universal pre-K on mothers are heterogeneous by children’s date of birth.","There are no significant effects from having a child in the universal pre-K program, except a small negative effect on the likelihood of prescriptions for those without younger children.",question,1707,186.0

3902,is fishing decreasing the genetic adaptive potential of fish?,Meta-analysis reveals lower genetic diversity in overfished populations.,"While population declines can drive the loss of genetic diversity under some circumstances, it has been unclear whether this loss is a general consequence of overharvest in highly abundant marine fishes. We compiled data from 11 049 loci across 140 species and found that allelic richness was lower in overfished populations within 9 of 12 genera and families. A multiple linear regression showed that allelic richness was on average 12% lower (P < 0.0001) in overharvested populations after accounting for the effects of body size, latitude and other factors. Heterozygosity was on average 2% lower (P = 0.030). Simulations confirmed that these patterns are consistent with a recent bottleneck in abundant species and also showed that our analysis likely underestimates the loss of rare alleles by a factor of two or three. This evidence suggests that overharvest drives the decay of genetic diversity across a wide range of marine fishes. Such reductions of genetic diversity in some of the world's most abundant species may lead to a long-term impact of fishing on their evolutionary potential, particularly if abundance remains low and diversity continues to decay.","Overfished populations have 12% lower genetic diversity, which may impact their long-term evolutionary potential.",question,1169,113.0
20879,what is the impact of the absence of public squares in cities?,Urban attractiveness in public squares: the mutual influence of the urban environment and the social activities in Batna,"Abstract This study examines how the components of the urban environment and its functionalities influence the attractiveness of public squares (PSs), and how they affect daily activities. This research is based on direct observations and surveys questionnaires. Data were collected from two PSs: May1st1945 square (MS, N=173) and Mohamed Harsous square (HS, N=97), located in Batna city centre (Algeria). The inquiry first includes an evaluation of urban environment layouts; a second evaluation to determine variables linked to environmental functionalities and utilization, and a third evaluation to assess social activities through characteristics of practices. The findings reveal that the components of the urban environment and its functionalities directly influence the attractiveness of PSs, mainly through proximity and comfort, and that shopping and leisure activities are also important for their attractiveness, but remain insufficient. This shows that attractiveness depends on the duration and variety of activities, including the interaction of people with these components to foster sociability. In addition, the use of these squares as a function of age and gender, and their appropriations are dealt with, since they have a direct effect on their uses and people’s preferences.","The attractiveness of public squares depends on the urban environment, its functionalities, proximity, comfort, and the variety of shopping and leisure activities available to foster sociability.",question,1296,195.0

21145,what are benefits of mindfulness?,Trait mindful awareness predicts inter-brain coupling but not individual brain responses during naturalistic face-to-face interactions,"In recent years, the possible benefits of mindfulness meditation have sparked much public and academic interest. Mindfulness emphasizes cultivating awareness of our immediate experience and has been associated with compassion, empathy, and various other prosocial traits. However, neurobiological evidence pertaining to the prosocial benefits of mindfulness in social settings is sparse. In this study, we investigate neural correlates of trait mindful awareness during naturalistic dyadic interactions, using both intra-brain and inter-brain measures. We used the Muse headset, a portable electroencephalogram (EEG) device often used to support mindfulness meditation, to record brain activity from dyads as they engaged in naturalistic face-to-face interactions in a museum setting. While we did not replicate prior laboratory-based findings linking trait mindfulness to individual brain responses (N = 379 individuals), self-reported mindful awareness did predict dyadic inter-brain synchrony, in theta (~5–8 Hz) and beta frequencies (~26-27 Hz; N = 62 dyads). These findings underscore the importance of conducting social neuroscience research in ecological settings to enrich our understanding of how (multi-brain) neural correlates of social traits such as mindful awareness manifest during social interaction, while raising critical practical considerations regarding the viability of commercially available EEG systems.",Mindful awareness predicts dyadic inter-brain synchrony during naturalistic face-to-face interactions.,question,1427,102.0
21159,can zinc help treat depression?,Zinc and Fatty Acids in Depression,"Polyunsaturated Fatty acids (PUFAs) seem to be helpful in the therapy of depression. Zinc (Zn) may be one co-factor contributing to their antidepressive effect. Zn acts lipid protective and is a constituent of fatty acid metabolism enzymes. In animals, an antidepressive effect of Zn was already demonstrated. Therefore, if and how Zn and PUFAs correlate in depressive patients or in individuals from the general population was investigated. Blood samples were collected from 88 depressive in-patients and 88 volunteers from the general population matched for age-group and gender (each 32 men and 56 women, 21–70 years) for measurement of Zn (colorimetric) and of 12 fatty acids (FAs) (by capillary gas-chromatography). Severity of depression in patients was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Zn concentration was independent of age, gender and body-mass-index and significantly correlated with the severity of depression measured by BDI (r = 0.26; P = 0.034) in depressive patients,. HDRS was inversely correlated with gammalinolenic acid concentration (r = −0.24; P = 0.029). Median serum Zn concentration in depressive patients did not differ from control individuals. Zn was correlated with myristic acid concentration (r = 0.22; P < 0.05) in controls from the general population; and a negative correlation between Zn and dihomogammalinolenic acid concentration (r = −0.26; P < 0.05) was found in depressive inpatients. FA composition in serum significantly differed between depressive and healthy persons: Depressive patients had higher stearic and arachidonic acid (AA) concentration. Relative to AA, their eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acid concentration were diminished compared to the general populations group. These results do not confirm the hypothesis of a general lack of Zn in depressive disorders, but Zn concentrations differed dependent on comorbid disorders and severity of depression. In depressive patients and control persons Zn concentration is associated with different FAs indicating diverging metabolic pathways.","Zinc concentrations in depressive patients did not differ from control individuals, but were correlated with the severity of depression and associated with different fatty acids.",question,2103,178.0

Therefore, it is important to investigate its effect on weight loss in humans, especially in women. We investigated the effects of green tea consumption combined with resistance training on the body composition and the resting metabolic rate (RMR) in women who were overweight or obese (grade I). After 4 weeks on an adaptive diet, 36 women were divided into four groups (group 1 green tea; group 2 placebo; group 3 green tea plus resistance training; group 4 placebo plus resistance training). The study was double-blinded and placebo-controlled. The RMR and body composition were ascertained for each volunteer, blood tests were performed, and subjects in groups 3 and 4 were tested for their one repetition maximum. Each subject followed the protocol and continued the diet for eight additional weeks, and periodic evaluations were administered. The mean RMR of group 1 decreased significantly and was accompanied by weight loss, maintenance of lean body mass, and decreases in both waist circumference and body mass index. Group 2 showed no variations in anthropometric or blood variables and significantly decreased their mean RMR. Group 3 showed significant increases in RMR, lean body mass, and muscle strength, and significant decreases in body fat, triglycerides, and waist circumference as compared to group 4. Green tea combined with resistance training its potential is increased with decreasing body fat, waist circumference, and triacylglyceride levels and by increasing lean body mass and muscle strength.","Green tea combined with resistance training can decrease body fat, waist circumference, and triacylglyceride levels while increasing lean body mass and muscle strength.",question,1593,168.0

The complexity and variability in symptoms pose serious challenges in treating IBS. Current therapy for IBS is primarily focused on reducing the abdominal pain, thereby improving the quality of life to a significant extent. Although the use of fiber rich diet is widely recommended in treating IBS, some studies have questioned its use. Intra‐colonic butyrate, a short‐chain fatty acid, is primarily produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon. In the existing literature there are conflicting reports about the function of butyrate. In rats it is known to induce visceral hypersensitivity without altered pathology, whereas in humans it has been reported to reduce visceral pain.

 Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown which type of exercise affects cognition. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that demanding balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition.
 
 
 
 To test the effect of balance training versus stretching relaxation exercise on memory and spatial cognition in cognitive enhancement.
 
 
 
 Participants randomly assigned into 2 groups, 40 participants in balance training group and 40 participants in stretching relaxation training group: Participants trained in groups of 10–12 individuals. Each group trained four times a week for 6 weeks. Each session lasts for 50 minutes. Training groups instructed by the same professional trainers. Each participant took part in 24 training sessions in total. All participants advised not to change their habitual level of physical activity throughout the intervention period.
 
 
 
 Balance performance improved only in the balance group from pre- to post-training from 85.8±3.0 to 95.0±2.2. Only the balance group improved in memory in wechsler IQ test from 94.6±2.6 to 108.0±4.5 and spatial cognitive abilities in spatial reasoning from 17.5±5.0 to 26.2±5.2. Finally, none of the two groups displayed changes in mismatch negativity test. The findings suggest that systematic balance training is capable of enhancing some cognitive functions, such as memory and spatial cognition.
 
 
 
 In sum, we are able to conclude that 6 weeks of balance training in healthy adults has positive effects on memory and spatial cognition, and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition. From an applied perspective, balance training might represent a promising alternative intervention for individuals who are not able to participate in aerobic training following health restrictions.

16664,does strip cropping technique helps to reduce soil erosion?,Soil erosion and surface runoff under strip tillage for sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) in Central Europe,"Abstract Soil erosion due to cultivation of row crops on soils with a high silt content can result in hazardous on-site and off-site damages. An effective and sustainable soil protection measure is to reduce the intensity of tillage. On-farm trials were conducted to compare the effect of strip tillage (ST), full-width reduced tillage (RT) and intensive tillage (IT) systems on surface runoff and soil loss in sugar beet crops grown on four typical loess sites in hilly regions of southern Germany in 2014 and 2015. Heavy rainfall (24 mm 20 min −1 ) was simulated in the 4–6 leaf stage of sugar beet with a small portable nozzle rainfall simulator. Observed data were used to establish soil loss ratios for ST as part of the cropping and management factor of RUSLE. Compared to IT, surface runoff was 55% and 92% lower for RT and ST, respectively, caused by increased water infiltration presumably due to (i) higher earthworm activity and (ii) the absence of negative effects of reduced tillage intensity on penetration resistance. Moreover, reducing tillage intensity increased surface residue cover, initial water content and organic carbon content in the topsoil layer. Soil loss was 85% and 98% lower for RT and ST compared to IT, respectively, as a result of (i) decreased runoff rates, (ii) higher stability of aggregates against the impact of raindrops and (iii) reduced velocity of the runoff flow and thereby lower sediment concentrations. Based on residue cover, the soil loss ratio calculated for ST agreed well with values established for other tillage systems. Overall, reducing tillage intensity by strip tillage was proven to offer environmental benefits due to reduced surface runoff and soil loss. In addition, plant-available water likely increases through enhanced infiltration.","Strip tillage reduces surface runoff by 92% and soil loss by 98% compared to intensive tillage, offering environmental benefits and likely increasing plant-available water through enhanced infiltration.",question,1798,202.0

However, its impact on the autonomic nervous system at night remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of BML exposure on parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity at night in elderly women. This nonrandomized controlled pilot study included female participants aged ≥ 60 years who were diagnosed with a type of dementia or cognitive disorder, excluding individuals with pacemakers. The treatment group was exposed to 2500 lx of BML, whereas the control group was exposed to 200 lx of general lighting. We measured heart rate variability to quantify ANS activity. The treatment group displayed significant increases in high-frequency (HF) power (Roy’s largest root = 1.62; p < 0.001) and nonsignificant decreases in normalized low-frequency (LF%) power. The corresponding nonsignificant decreases in the low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio and cognitive function were correlated with PSNS activity (Roy’s largest root = 1.41; p < 0.001), which improved severe dementia. BML exposure reduced SNS activity and enhanced PSNS activity at night in female participants, which improved cognitive function.

1262,what is landslide susceptibility?,"Landslide Inventory, Susceptibility, Hazard and Risk Mapping","Landslide is that the downslope movement of debris, rocks, or earth material under the influence of the force of gravity. Although the causes and mechanisms of landslides are complicated, human action, earthquakes, and severe rainfall can trigger them. It can happen when the driving force surpasses the resisting force due to natural soil or rock slope destabilization. Landslide is one of the foremost destructive and dangerous natural hazards that cause numerous fatalities and economic losses worldwide. Therefore, landslide investigation, susceptibility, hazard, and risk mapping are vital tasks to disaster loss reduction and performance as a suggestion for sustainable land use planning. The determination of the cause variables, identification of existing landslides, and production of a landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk map are all necessary steps in the mitigation of landslide incidence on the globe. Landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk maps are the outcome of a statistical relationship between environmental conditions and previously occurring landslides. It provides critical scientific support for the government’s reaction to land use practices and the management of landslide threats.

Methods: Data from the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample was utilized, which consisted of 366 participants (Mage = 43 years; 63% female). Physical activity was self-reported using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Hippocampal–orbitofrontal functional connectivity was assessed from magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Moderate-intensity physical activity was not statistically significantly associated with left hippocampal–orbitofrontal connectivity (β = 0.001; 95% CI: −0.02, 0.03; P = 0.90) or right hippocampal–orbitofrontal connectivity (β = 0.01; 95% CI: −0.01, 0.04; P = 0.22). However, vigorous-intensity physical activity was statistically significantly associated with right hippocampal–orbitofrontal connectivity (β = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.004, 0.02; P = 0.002). Discussion: Habitual engagement in intense physical activity was associated with greater hippocampal–orbitofrontal connectivity, while moderate activity engagement was not. This may have important implications for the exercise neurobiology field in the context of exercise and memory function, suggesting that intense activity may facilitate cognitive/memory functions. However, our findings should be interpreted with caution given the relatively weak associations that were observed.","Vigorous-intensity physical activity is associated with greater hippocampal–orbitofrontal connectivity, while moderate-intensity activity is not.",phrase,1434,145.0

Relationship between maximum pull-up repetitions and first repetition mean concentric velocity. J Strength Cond Res 32(7): 1831–1837, 2018—Mean concentric velocity (MCV) of exercise execution has been used by strength and conditioning professionals to improve exercise technique, provide accurate feedback, and predict exercise 1 repetition maximum. There is still limited research on velocity-based training and currently only one research study on the pull-up exercise. The primary purpose of this research was to determine whether the maximum number of pull-ups an individual can perform can be predicted by the MCV of a single pull-up repetition. Forty-nine healthy men and women were recruited who reported they could do at least 2 pull-ups. Each subject performed a standardized warm-up, then a single pull-up repetition, followed by one set of pull-up repetitions to failure. The GymAware PowerTool, a linear position transducer, was used to measure the MCV of each pull-up repetition. Both the MCV of the single repetition and first repetition of the set to failure were recorded, and the greater of the 2 was used in later analysis. Weighted least squares linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between the single-repetition MCV and maximum amount of pull-up repetitions. We observed a statistically significant linear relationship between the maximum number of pull-ups and the MCV of a single pull-up repetition (y = −6.661 + 25.556x, R2 = 0.841). Prediction of the maximum pull-up number by a single repetition rather than testing the maximal pull-up number may improve efficiency and effectiveness of exercise testing batteries for military, police, and other populations.",The maximum number of pull-ups can be predicted by the mean concentric velocity (MCV) of a single pull-up repetition.,question,1788,117.0

20089,to what extent does the mood of instagram posts differ in terms of their payment,Strategies of Personal Account Promotion on Instagram,"In the article, an Instagram page is considered as part of mass communications which brings money and other benefits to its holder. Deep interviews with Russian Instagram bloggers confirmed our hypothesis: each account represents a separate medium with its own information and advertising policy. The article explores such parameters as content planning, interaction with subscribers, advertisers and other bloggers, as well as ROI assessment via the Statistics tool. Promotion in Instagram is achieved through the observance of aesthetic norms and thematic and stylistic unity. In-depth interviews with domestic bloggers confirmed our hypothesis: each separate account is actually a mini-media with its information and advertising policies. The author of the blog thus functions as a curator, or ""issuing editor"": there is a careful selection of photos that correspond to the concept, themes, and most importantly-the style of the account. There is an important difference between a business SM manager and an independent Instagram blogger: while the former makes content plans for approval with the client, the latter does not rely on long-term planning; instead, he/she procures posts the night before or creates them just before publication. This achieves the effect of sincerity, the sense of ""being in the moment"", which subscribers appreciate. Graphic content plays the primary role in the promotion of the profile. Additional coverage is provided by hashtags, interaction with subscribers, participation in the #sfs flashmob and symmetric content exchange between bloggers of the same level. It is possible to measure ROI via independent audit by means of the ""Stats"" tool built into Instagram. This allows to better understand the audience and adjust communication to expand influence. Cooperation with brands starts on average from 10K subscribers. The blogger presents his/her audience and proposes a joint project. The success of advertising placement largely depends on how well the ad post corresponds with the established aesthetics of the profile. Affiliate publications are placed in the main profile, as well as in Stories-a special section with photos and 15-second videos, which are deleted 24 hours after the publication. Reach of such publications is lower, but they are better perceived by subscribers, and placement in Stories costs advertisers cheaper than in the grid. The greatest coverage comes from getting a post featured in the ""Trends"" section; however, this is regulated by proprietary algorithms within Instagram, and is not possible to predict.","Instagram promotion relies on aesthetic norms and thematic unity, with bloggers carefully selecting photos that correspond to their account's style, creating a sense of sincerity and being in the moment.",question,2579,203.0

However, there are mixed results. For example, a correlation between low vitamin D and mood disorders has been observed [24-26] but other studies have shown no such associations [27,28]. A 2014 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials including 4,923 subjects showed no significant reduction in depressive symptoms following vitamin D supplementation [29]. The authors of this meta-analysis noted that most of the studies focused on individuals with low levels of depression and sufficient vitamin D levels at baseline. They suggest that future RCTs be conducted with individuals with depression and low vitamin D levels. The authors also point out that there was variability in the doses of vitamin D administered. In the experience of the lead author of our paper normalizing abnormally low levels of vitamin D often requires supplementation well above the recommended daily allowances. In the support of this, a small RCT of 36 subjects, treated with 50,000 IU vitamin D per week showed a trend toward greater improvement compared to placebo (P=.06), but also showed improvement on a number of biomarkers of oxidative stress and insulin resistance [30].

Given this importance, this paper intends to assess its impact on the Return on Equity (ROE), as opposed to the more traditional net income, for the period 2004-2008 for the select group of the Spanish IBEX-35 listed companies. Moreover, working on this period will also allow us to verify the incidence of comprehensive income on the ROE within a context of economic crisis, especially for the year 2008, with a large recession and steep drops in the stock markets. For this empirical study, we took as reference the pertinent information disclosed in the Consolidated Annual Reports of these listed companies, formulated pursuant to the IFRS by the IASB, especially pursuant to IAS 1.The non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used to perform the corresponding statistic comparisons, as the variables in certain years did not conform to normalcy. The results of our paper show a statistically significant impact of the ROE calculated pursuant to comprehensive income as opposed to the ROE determined pursuant to the net income. This was evidenced for three of the five years that were studied, especially for 2008, when there was a spectacular decline in the ROE calculated pursuant to the comprehensive income as opposed to that calculated pursuant to the net income. We consider this could be a contribution to the international debate regarding the need to include other measurements of corporate performance that are broader than the traditional net income in certain ratios of the fundamental analysis.

8754,are humans are divided into biological races?,Genetics and the Origin of Human “Races”,"In the last decades, the concept of human races was considered scientifically unfounded as it was not confirmed by genetic evidence. None of the racial classifications, which strongly differ in the number of races and their composition, reflects actual genetic similarity and genealogy of human populations inferred from variability of classical markers and DNA regions. Moreover, intercontinental (“interracial”) variability was shown to be far lower than that within populations: the former constitutes 7 to 10% of the total genetic variation and the latter about 85% of it. It is believed that the low level of differentiation of regional population groups contradicts their race status and suggests a recent origin of humans from one ancestral population. The results of studies of various genetic systems are in agreement with the latter conclusion rejecting the hypothesis of regional continuity. According to this hypothesis, the populations of continents regarded as large races have developed during long evolution from local types of archaic humans, in particular, Neanderthals. Phenotypic similarity of different, sometimes unrelated, populations united into one “race” is explained by strong selection since race-diagnostic traits characterize body surface and thus are directly subjected to the influence of environmental (primarily climatic) factors. It has been recently established that variability of the most important of these traits, body and hair pigmentation, is largely controlled by one locus (MC1R), which accounts for its high evolutionary lability. Other traits used for race identification are also likely to be labile and controlled by major genes. However, the fact that the currently existing race classifications are groundless does not mean that such classifications are impossible in principle. Commonly used argumentation (races do not exist because populations are not genetically separated) does not hold water. A polytypic species is characterized by genetic continuity of allopatric populations rather than the presence of narrow genetic boundaries between them. Borderlines between races are usually conventional and arbitrary. As to intergroup variation in humans, it is indeed low but comparable with that in a number of other species. There are no obstacles to the development of genetic systematics of human races.","Human races are not confirmed by genetic evidence, as intercontinental variability is far lower than within populations, constituting only 7-10% of total genetic variation.",question,2358,172.0

By monitoring the SCN neuronal activity rhythm in vitro, I first confirm that the 5HT1A/5HT7 agonist (+)DPAT maximally advances the SCN clock when applied at zeitgeber time 6 (ZT6). Conversely, NPY only phase advances the neuronal activity rhythm when applied at ZT 10. This effect occurs through stimulation of Y2 receptors. NPY, again acting through Y2 receptors, blocks (+)DPAT-induced phase shifts at ZT 6, while neither (+)DPAT nor 5-HT affect NPY-induced phase shifts at ZT 10. NPY appears to block (+)DPAT-induced phase shifts by preventing increases in cyclic AMP. These data are the first to demonstrate in vitro interactions between daytime resetting stimuli in the rat, and provide critical insights into mechanisms controlling circadian clock phase.","NPY blocks serotonergic phase shifts of the circadian clock in vitro, affecting the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) clock resetting.",question,1181,129.0
2390,what is the frequency of sarcopenia in inflammatory bowel patients?,Sarcopenia as an independent predictor of the surgical outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk of sarcopenia, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We conducted this study to assess whether sarcopenia predicts the need for surgery and postoperative complications in patients with IBD. We performed a systematic search of four electronic databases, last updated in March, 2019. Data from studies comparing rates of surgery and postoperative complications in sarcopenic IBD patients versus non-sarcopenic IBD patients were pooled with the random-effects models. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Ten studies with a collective total of 885 IBD patients were included in our meta-analysis. Although the analysis of raw data did not reveal significant differences between the two groups with respect to the rate of surgery and postoperative complications (OR = 1.826; 95% CI 0.913–3.654; p = 0.089 and OR = 3.265; 95% CI 0.575–18.557; p = 0.182, respectively), the analysis of adjusted data identified sarcopenia as an independent predictor for both of the undesirable outcomes (OR = 2.655; 95% CI 1.121–6.336; p = 0.027 and OR = 6.097; 95% CI 1.756–21.175; p = 0.004, respectively).

16158,macroeconomic determinants for ipo activity,Wpływ wybranych zmiennych makroekonomicznych na liczbę pierwszych ofert publicznych – sytuacja polskiego rynku giełdowego,"Background: The impact of macroeconomic variables on the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) was analysed. Individual general economic indicators affect the stock market in different ways. The results of research taking into account their impact on the number of IPOs carried out in different countries are also varied. Therefore, it was decided to conduct an analysis in this respect, focusing on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), indirectly trying to check whether the results of foreign research are reflected in the situation of the Polish market. 
Research purpose: The main motive for undertaking the research was to verify the impact of selected macroeconomic indicators on the number of IPOs. This goal was followed by the following research hypotheses: the GDP growth rate positively influences the number of IPOs, the interest rate negatively affects this variable, and the increase in the rates of return on the Warsaw Stock Exchange Index (WIG) contributes to the increase in the number of IPOs. 
Methods: Empirical verification of macroeconomic variables’ impact on the number of IPOs was carried out using linear regression models. For the annual models, the estimation was carried out using the Least Squares (OLS) method, and in the case of quarterly models – also using the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) method in order to avoid heteroscedasticity of the residuals. The number of IPOs in 2005–2019 was analysed and explained with indicators delayed by 1 period. 
Conclusions: The rate of return on WIG had a significant positive impact on the number of IPOs in the next period, both under annual and quarterly models. In the case of other variables, their significant impact on the number of IPOs was observed only in the case of quarterly ones. The GDP growth rate showed a positive correlation with the number of IPOs, which is in line with the previously formulated hypothesis, similarly to the rates of return from WIG. A positive impact on the number of IPOs was also noted in the case of the reference interest rate – this result differed from the expected one. Apart from the results of the study, one can also point to the purposefulness of using models prepared on the basis of both annual and quarterly data, in the case of examining the impact of macroeconomic variables on the number of IPOs.","The rate of return on WIG and GDP growth rate positively impact the number of IPOs, while the reference interest rate also showed a positive impact, contrary to expectations.",phrase,2328,174.0

19812,how to achieve flow state experiences,Optimal experiences in exercise: A qualitative investigation of flow and clutch states,"Objectives: Understanding how to promote rewarding exercise experiences is important for attempts to help individuals be physically active. This qualitative study aimed to investigate the optimal psychological states experienced during rewarding exercise activities. Specifically, participants were interviewed as soon as possible after recent, rewarding exercise experiences in order to maximise detail and accuracy of recall. Design: Event‐focused qualitative study. Method: A sample of 18 individuals (Mage = 32.94 years) participated in event‐focused, semi‐structured interviews soon after a rewarding exercise experience (M = 2 days later). Data were analysed thematically, while strategies were employed to enhance trustworthiness. Results: Participants reported two distinct optimal experiences during rewarding exercise activities, matching descriptions of flow and clutch states. Flow occurred in contexts involving exploration, novelty/variation, and flexible outcomes, while the experience was described as enjoyable at the time, and involved lower perceived effort. Clutch states occurred in contexts involving achievement and pressure. Exercisers perceived clutch states to be enjoyable afterwards but not at the time, and to involve intense effort. Notable differences were apparent in the outcomes of each state in that flow had an energising effect, whereas clutch states were fatiguing. Conclusions: This study presents evidence for flow and clutch states in exercise, supporting emerging research in sport. These findings provide insights into the occurrence, experience, and outcomes of flow and clutch states specifically from the exerciser's perspective. Such insights can inform future research on flow and clutch states in this setting, and may provide strategies for reliably inducing each state during exercise.","Flow state experiences in exercise occur in contexts involving exploration, novelty/variation, and flexible outcomes, with lower perceived effort and enjoyment during the activity.",question,1836,180.0
12163,does mail in voting lead to fraud?,Security Survey and Analysis of Vote-by-Mail Systems,"Voting by mail has been gaining traction for decades in the United States and has emerged as the preferred voting method during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration. We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these systems.","Online voter registration systems have vulnerabilities that could disenfranchise voters and reduce confidence in elections, but are unlikely to enable vote modification.",question,1168,169.0

10631,relationship between child psychology and technology,Introduction to the special issue: eHealth in pediatric psychology.,"The interaction between psychology and technology has a rich history. Psychologists have always been resourceful in finding ways to utilize technology to enhance the provision of clinical care. However, the proliferation of computers and the Internet has vastly expanded the possibilities. The Internet, in particular, has ushered in the new field of eHealth within psychology. eHealth has been defined as the delivery of health services and information through the Internet and related technologies (Eysenbach, 2001). Given that families with children have a very high rate of computer (93%) and cell phone (95%) ownership (Kennedy, Smith, Wells, & Wellman, 2008), as well as the notable fact that 93% of youth (ages 12–17 years) and 94% of parents of these teens (87% of all parents) are online (Macgill, 2007), this has particular relevance to pediatric psychology. The Internet has become an important source of health care and medical information. Between 75% and 80% of Internet users have searched for health-related information online, making the act of looking for health information one of the most popular uses of the Internet (Fox, 2006, 2008). Parents, in particular, frequently use the Internet to search for information about their child’s condition (Whyte & Hunter, 2008), and are more likely to use the Internet, and to look for health and medical information online, than nonparents (Fox, 2005). In addition, parents whose children suffer from a chronic condition are more likely to search the Internet for health-related information than those who have healthy children or children with acute conditions (Tuffrey & Finlay, 2002).","The internet has become a key source of health care information, especially for parents seeking information about their child's condition.",phrase,1648,138.0

Many studies have documented these differences as a result of a variety of different social factors. An emerging emphasis is the impact of racism in its various forms on physical and mental health. Social stress theory conceptualizes racism as a social stresssor which can produce negative health consequences for racial minorities. This study uses binary logit and negative binomial regression models of four items from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to test social stress theory and examine the relationship between stress symptoms from perceived racism and overall health (N = 32,585). The effect of race on the experience of emotional and physical stress symptoms from racism is substantial.

Methods: Adults with self-reported depression were randomized to receive fortnightly food hampers and MedDiet cooking workshops for 3 months and fish oil supplements for 6 months, or attend social groups fortnightly for 3 months. Assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months included mental health, quality of life (QoL) and dietary questionnaires, and blood samples for erythrocyte fatty acid analysis. Results: n = 152 eligible adults aged 18–65 were recruited (n = 95 completed 3-month and n = 85 completed 6-month assessments). At 3 months, the MedDiet group had a higher MedDiet score (t = 3.95, P < 0.01), consumed more vegetables (t = 3.95, P < 0.01), fruit (t = 2.10, P = 0.04), nuts (t = 2.29, P = 0.02), legumes (t = 2.41, P = 0.02) wholegrains (t = 2.63, P = 0.01), and vegetable diversity (t = 3.27, P < 0.01); less unhealthy snacks (t = −2.10, P = 0.04) and red meat/chicken (t = −2.13, P = 0.04). The MedDiet group had greater reduction in depression (t = −2.24, P = 0.03) and improved mental health QoL scores (t = 2.10, P = 0.04) at 3 months.

Objectives To evaluate the effects of a Mediterranean (MED) diet (carbohydrate 42%, protein 17%, fat 41%, SFAs 8%, MUFAs 26%, PUFAs 8%) with 14 (MED0.5; 0.5 oz), 71 (MED2.5; 2.5 oz), and 156 (MED5.5; 5.5 oz) g/d/2000 kcal lean beef compared with an average American diet (AAD; carbohydrate 52%, protein 15%, fat 33%, SFAs 12%, MUFAs 13%, PUFAs 8%) on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, particle number, and size. Methods This was a multicenter, 4-period controlled feeding, randomized crossover study. Fifty-nine generally healthy males and females (BMI 20–38 kg/m2; age 30–65 y) consumed each diet for 4 wk with a ≥1-wk washout between the diets. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each 4-wk period. Lipid subfractions were measured by NMR. Results Compared with the AAD, all 3 MED diets decreased LDL cholesterol (MED0.5: −10.3 mg/dL; 95% CI: −5.4, −15.7 mg/dL; MED2.5: −9.1 mg/dL; 95% CI: −3.9, −14.3 mg/dL; MED5.5: −6.9 mg/dL; 95% CI: −1.7, −12.1 mg/dL; P < 0.0001). All MED diets elicited similar reductions in total LDL particle number compared with baseline (P < 0.005); however, significant decreases only occurred with MED0.5 (−91.2 nmol/L; 95% CI: −31.4, −151.0 nmol/L) and MED2.5 (−85.3 nmol/L; 95% CI: −25.4, −145.2 nmol/L) compared with AAD (P < 0.003). Compared with the AAD, non-HDL cholesterol (P < 0.01) and apoB (P < 0.01) were lower following the 3 MED diets; there were no differences between the MED diets. All diets reduced HDL-cholesterol and HDL particle number from baseline (P < 0.01).

9503,Do gas stoves cause asthma?,"Exposure to indoor combustion and adult asthma outcomes: environmental tobacco smoke, gas stoves, and woodsmoke","Background: Because they have chronic airway inflammation, adults with asthma may be particularly susceptible to indoor air pollution. Despite widespread exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), gas stoves, and woodsmoke, the impact of these exposures on adult asthma has not been well characterised. Methods: Data were used from a prospective cohort study of 349 adults with asthma who underwent structured telephone interviews at baseline and 18 month follow up. The prospective impact of ETS, gas stove, and woodsmoke exposure on health outcomes was examined. Results: ETS exposure at baseline interview was associated with impaired health status at longitudinal follow up. Compared with respondents with no baseline self-reported exposure to ETS, higher level exposure (≥7 hours/week) was associated with worse severity of asthma scores at follow up, controlling for baseline asthma severity, age, sex, race, income, and educational attainment (mean score increment 1.5 points; 95% CI 0.4 to 2.6). Higher level baseline exposure to ETS was also related to poorer physical health status (mean decrement –4.9 points; 95% CI –8.4 to –1.3) and asthma specific quality of life (mean increase 4.4 points; 95% CI –0.2 to 9.0) at longitudinal follow up. Higher level baseline ETS exposure was associated with a greater risk of emergency department visits (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 10.3) and hospital admissions for asthma at prospective follow up (OR 12.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 102).

9676,what effect does orientalism have in movies?,Chinese History and the Question of Orientalism,"The discussion develops Edward Said's thesis of orientialism. Said approached ""orientalism"" as a construction of Asia by Europeans, and a problem in Euro-American modernity. This essay argues that, from the beginning, Asians participated in the construction of the orient, and that orientalism therefore should be viewed as a problem in Asian modernities as well. The essay utilizes Mary Louise Pratt's idea of ""contact zones"" to argue that orientalism was a product of the circulation of Euro-American and Asian intellectuals in these contact zones, or borderlands. While orientalism has been very much implicated in power relations between Euro-America and Asia, the question of power nevertheless should be separated analytically from the construction of orientalism. In support of this argument, the essay points to the contemporary ""selforientalization"" of Asian intellectuals, which is a manifestation not of powerlessness but newly-acquired power. I consider below some questions raised by orientalism as concept and practice. These questions have their origins in Edward Said's Orientalism, published in 1978, which has had a lasting impact on Third World cultural studies in Europe and the United States. ' Provocative as Said's book was in its critique of orientalism as practice, its larger significance rests on Said's relentless demonstration of the intersection of historical interpretation, culture, and politics in EuroAmerican studies of Asia. I will argue, contrary to critics of Said, that questions raised by this intersection are still very much relevant to problems of historical interpretation of Asia in general, and China in particular. On the other hand, I will suggest also that contemporary historiographical evidence calls for a recasting of the relationship between history, culture, and politics in a configuration that is significantly different from Said's conceptualization of it in Orientalism. On the basis of this reconfigured understanding of orientalism, I will reflect by way of conclusion on the possibilities of escaping the burden of orientalism in historical studies. Because orientalism as concept refers to the ""orient"" as a whole, in illustrating my arguments I will draw on evidence from the career of orientalism not just in the historiography of China but in other histories as well. Finally, I am concerned here not with specific historiographical questions, but with questions that are best characterized as metahistorical. 1. Edward W. Said, Orientalism (New York, 1979).

12239,How effective is regenerative farming?,Restoring soil quality of woody agroecosystems in Mediterranean drylands through regenerative agriculture,"Abstract Regenerative agriculture (RA) is gaining increasing recognition as a plausible solution to restore degraded agroecosystems. In Mediterranean drylands, RA is at incipient state of development and has been limitedly adopted by farmers, partly due to the lack of empirical evidence on its impacts. To support its large-scale adoption, we carried out a participatory monitoring project in southeast Spain, involving local farmers applying different RA practices in 9 almond farms. To assess the effect of RA, in each farm we selected one field with regenerative management and one nearby field with conventional management based on frequent tillage (CT). We clustered fields under regenerative management based on the RA practices applied by farmers and distinguished 4 types of RA treatments: 1) reduced tillage with green manure (GM), 2) reduced tillage with organic amendments (OA), 3) reduced tillage with green manure and organic amendments (GM&OA), and 4) no tillage with permanent natural covers and organic amendments (NT&OA). We evaluated the impacts of RA compared to CT by comparing physical (bulk density and aggregate stability), chemical (pH, salinity, total N, P, K, available P, and exchangeable cations) and biological (SOC, POC, PON, microbial activity) properties of soil quality and the nutritional status of almond trees (leaf N, P and K). Our results show that GM improved soil physical properties, presenting higher soil aggregate stability. We found that OA improved most soil chemical and biological properties, showing higher contents of SOC, POC, PON, total N, K, P, available P, exchangeable cations and microbial respiration. RA treatments combining ground covers and organic amendments (GM&OA and NT&OA) exhibited greater overall soil quality restoration than individual practices. NT&OA stood out for presenting the highest soil quality improvements. All RA treatments maintained similar crop nutritional status compared to CT. We conclude that RA has strong potential to restore the physical, chemical and biological quality of soils of woody agroecosystems in Mediterranean drylands without compromising their nutritional status, thereby enhancing their resilience to climate change and long term sustainability.","Regenerative agriculture has strong potential to restore the physical, chemical, and biological quality of soils in Mediterranean drylands without compromising crop nutritional status.",question,2250,184.0

The composition and molecular weight distribution of CPP were determined by elemental analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively. The microstructure and size distribution of CPP were then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanometer analyzer instrument. Finally, CPP was treated with corn starch (CS), and the swelling behavior of the resulting CPP-CS blend was investigated in order to determine its range of applications. The experimental data showed that CPP contains 13 different amino-acids. CPP also displayed low mineral salt levels and a nitrogen content of 43.84%, indicating its potential use as an organic fertilizer. The molecular weight range of CPP is 6.5 to ~ 26.6 kDa. After the obtained CPP was blended with CS, the CPP-CS blend is endowed with optimal swelling properties and is able to overcome the solubility drawbacks of CPP alone. In addition, when the CPP was used as a natural fertilizer, the germination rate and height of kidney beans obviously increased.","CPP contains 13 different amino acids and has potential use as an organic fertilizer, improving the germination rate and height of kidney beans.",question,1166,144.0
14039,does intergroup contact reduce xenophobia?,Modern avenues for intergroup contact: Using E-contact and intergroup emotions to reduce stereotyping and social distancing against people with schizophrenia,"Intergroup contact is the leading strategy for reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. For the first time, the current study examines the effectiveness of a contemporary intergroup contact strategy, called electronic or E-contact, to reduce stigma against people diagnosed with schizophrenia. It also examines the mediating role of three target-relevant intergroup emotions, namely fear, anger, and pity. In total, 133 participants engaged in E-contact with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia (intergroup E-contact), E-contact with a person without a mental illness (intragroup E-contact), or no contact. Compared to the intragroup E-contact and no-contact conditions, intergroup E-contact reduced fear, anger, and stereotyping toward people with schizophrenia. Additionally, fear and anger, but not pity, were found to be significant affective mediators of the E-contact effect. The findings demonstrate the value of computer-mediated intergroup contact for stigma reduction, and emphasize the importance of intergroup emotions in this domain.","Intergroup E-contact reduces fear, anger, and stereotyping towards people with schizophrenia, demonstrating its potential for stigma reduction.",question,1059,143.0

To investigate the correlation between synovial inflammatory changes (synovial blood signals, synovial thickness, joint effusion) and cartilage injury, meniscus prominence of knee osteo-arthritis (KOA) under energy Doppler ultrasound and further to assess the value of ultrasound for prognostic judgment in KOA. 
 
 
Methods 
A total of 291 KOA patients from our hospital from 2016 to 2018 were collected. The patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with knee joints involved were recruited as control group. The data that conform to the normal distribution were expressed by mean±SD, and others were represented by M (P25, P75). The t test, the rank test and Chi-square test were used between the two groups, and ANOVA or K-W test was used to compare the data between the multiple groups, Spearman correlation analysis was used for correlation analysis. 
 
 
Results 
① The proportion of synovial blood flow signal in KOA group was lower than RA group (19.6% vs 47.7%, χ2=286.2, P 0.05). ESR from KOA group were both significantly lower than controls but the synovial blood signals was the same except for power Doppler signal-2 group(Z=-8.414, Z=-4.991, t=-3.428, all P<0.05); hs-CRP from KOA group were both significantly lower than controls but the synovial blood signals was the same. ③ A total of 489 knee joints were detected in 291 patients with KOA, of which synovial blood flow signals were found in 96 joints, the power Doppler signal-I group was the most frequent in KOA(80/96, 83.3%). In addition, joint effusion and synovial thickening were positively correlated with the synovial blood signals, (r=0.277, r=0.411, all P<0.05).④ At last, the degrees of ultrasound blood flow signal in KOA group was positively associated with the WOMAC score, the Lequsne index and US-1 score (r=0.352, r=0.424, r=0.59, all P<0.05). 
 
 
Conclusion 
Energy Doppler ultrasonography can be used to detect the KOA synovitis. Synovitis is not rare in KOA patients, and which is associated with disease activity. However, KOA and RA cannot be differentiated by energy Doppler ultrasonography.

 Subject
 Global property prices.
 
 
 Significance
 House prices have surged in the last five years, mostly in high-income economies where demand has rebounded after falling in the aftermath of the 2008-09 recession. Adjusted for inflation, house prices rose steadily across the world between 2013 and 2018, raising concerns about the downside risks associated with overvaluations. 
 
 
 Impacts
 Housing markets are difficult to tune; lenient policies aimed at supporting immediate activity will increase longer-run risks.
 Real estate markets are becoming more synchronised, and more exposed to common downside risks if global financial flows drop.
 Cities and financial centres in advanced and emerging nations are most exposed as they enjoy more flows of volatile capital.

9233,can prayer heal disease?,Prayer and health outcomes in church members.,"CONTEXT
This study adds to the existing research on religion and health by focusing on the specific practice of prayer and its relationship to health outcomes.


OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this survey is to examine the relationship of frequency of prayer to 8 categories of physical and mental health.


DESIGN
The Presbyterian Church, USA, performed data collection as part of an ongoing research program. Members of the Presbyterian Church were randomly selected from the national population and surveyed by mail on their frequency of prayer and their health status, as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short-form 36 Health Survey.


RESULTS
Self-reports of health indicated a high level of functioning overall for all 8 categories of physical and mental health. People who prayed more often scored lower in their physical functioning and their ability to carry out role activities, and higher in their reports of physical pain. However, people who prayed more often also had significantly higher mental health scores than did those who prayed less frequently, despite their physical health problems.


CONCLUSION
This study supports the relationship of a high frequency of prayer with a more positive mental health. Various explanations of the results are explored.","A high frequency of prayer is associated with more positive mental health, but not necessarily with physical health improvements.",question,1273,129.0
17680,Can intergroup contact reduce inequality?,"Contact Theory, Intergroup","Intergroup contact theory proposes that intergroup prejudice can be reduced when members of different groups interact with each other under optimal conditions. Allport (1954) developed what has become the most influential statement of intergroup contact theory, stating that prejudice will be reduced when the contact situation embodies four primary conditions: (1) equal status between groups; (2) common goals; (3) cooperation between groups; and (4) support of institutional authorities, law, or custom. Rather than being thought of as independent factors, these conditions are typically conceived of as interrelated factors that function jointly to reduce intergroup prejudice. For example, efforts to establish equal status between groups in the contact situation can be bolstered by institutional authorities who support norms of equality and offer guidance regarding how members of different groups should treat each other. Similarly, encouraging groups to cooperate should involve some degree of interdependence, such that members of these groups must work together, and rely on each other, in order to achieve their shared goals.

22453,effect of socioeconomic status on meat consumption,"Jerkies, tacos, and burgers: Subjective socioeconomic status and meat preference","In mankind's evolutionary past, those who consumed meat were strong and powerful and thus man saw meat as indicative of social status. This symbolic connection between meat and status persists today. Thus, based upon psychological theories of compensation, individuals low on subjective socioeconomic status (SES) should have a greater preference for meat, as meat may be substitutable for the status that they lack. Three experiments tested this premise. Participants who felt low on subjective SES preferred meat-based foods compared to participants who felt high on it (Experiment 1). The effect is driven by a desire for status (Experiments 2-3) and not by felt hunger or power (Experiments 1-2) and not generalizable to plant foods (Experiment 3). The results suggest a symbolic link between meat and status, which has intriguingly not yet been empirically shown, and we also demonstrate a consequence of the link for food preference. The results may be of use for doctors who advise eating less meat to improve physical health and for environmental advocates who argue that meat consumption exacerbates global warming. We will also discuss the contributions of and further avenues based on our work.",Individuals with low subjective socioeconomic status (SES) have a greater preference for meat-based foods compared to those with high SES.,phrase,1205,138.0

14487,what is corporate sociopolitical activism?,Corporate Sociopolitical Activism and Firm Value,"Stakeholders have long pressured firms to provide societal benefits in addition to generating shareholder wealth. Such benefits have traditionally come in the form of corporate social responsibility. However, many stakeholders now expect firms to demonstrate their values by expressing public support for or opposition to one side of a partisan sociopolitical issue, a phenomenon the authors call “corporate sociopolitical activism” (CSA). Such activities differ from commonly favored corporate social responsibility and have the potential to both strengthen and sever stakeholder relationships, thus making their impact on firm value uncertain. Using signaling and screening theories, the authors analyze 293 CSA events initiated by 149 firms across 39 industries, and find that, on average, CSA elicits an adverse reaction from investors. Investors evaluate CSA as a signal of a firm’s allocation of resources away from profit-oriented objectives and toward a risky activity with uncertain outcomes. The authors further identify two sets of moderators: (1) CSA’s deviation from key stakeholders’ values and brand image and (2) characteristics of CSA’s resource implementation, which affect investor and customer responses. The findings provide new and important implications for marketing theory and practice.","Corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) is when firms publicly support or oppose one side of a partisan sociopolitical issue, which can impact firm value.",question,1311,154.0

In particular, the $3 threshold level associated with continued optionability and the listing of new option series was eliminated. The rule changes allow each option exchange to expand from 10 to 55 the number of stocks selected for inclusion in the $1 Strike Program. Additionally, the lower bound of permissible $1 strike price was reduced from $3 to $1.

10162,what mirna upregulate anti-oxidant genes,Relationship Between Downregulation of miRNAs and Increase of Oxidative Stress in the Development of Diabetic Cardiac Dysfunction: Junctin as a Target Protein of miR-1,"Oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction while microRNAs (miRNAs) are known as regulators for genes involved in cardiac remodeling. However, a functional link between miRNAs and diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction remains to be investigated. Here, we aimed to identify whether the expression levels of miRNAs are associated with oxidative stress/diabetic heart and if proteins responsible from contractile activity during diabetes might be directly modulated by miRNAs. Diabetic cardiomyopathy developed with streptozotocin, is characterized with marked changes in sarcomere and mitochondria, depressed left ventricular developed pressure, and a massive oxidative stress that is particularly evident in the heart. miRNA profiling was performed in freshly isolated left ventricular cells from diabetic rats. Using microarray analysis, we identified marked changes in the expression of 43 miRNAs (37 of them were downregulated while 6 miRNAs were upregulated) out of examined total of 351 miRNAs. Among them, 6 miRNAs were further validated by real-time PCR. The expression levels of miR-1, miR-499, miR-133a, and miR-133b were markedly depressed in the diabetic cardiomyocytes while miR-21 level increased and miR-16 level was unchanged. Notably, normalization of cardiac function and oxidant/antioxidant level after N-acetylcysteine (NAC)-treatment of diabetic rats resulted with a significant restoration in the expression levels of miR-499, miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-133b in the myocardium. Since changes in the level of muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac diseases and its specific molecular targets involved in its action, in part, associated with oxidative stress are limited, we first examined the protein levels of some SR-associated proteins such as junctin and triadin. Junctin but not triadin is markedly overexpressed in diabetic cardiomyocytes while its level was normalized in NAC-treated diabetics. Luciferase reporter assay showed that junctin is targetted by miR-1. Taken together, our data demonstrates that intervention with an antioxidant treatment for 4-week leads to significant cardioprotection against diabetes-induced injury, controlling oxidant/antioxidant level, which may directly control the levels of some miRNAs including miR-1 and its target protein junctin, which is involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.","N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment restores the expression levels of miR-499, miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-133b in diabetic hearts, potentially controlling oxidant/antioxidant levels.",question,2415,177.0

Two ways of deriving GD scales yielded highly similar results. Moderate stability of individual differences was found across ages 12 to 16 among adolescents, but substantial shifts over age occurred in relationships with Eysenck scales.

In the present study, we examined how the activities of these gloss-selective IT neurons are related to perceived gloss. In an earlier psychophysical study, Ferwerda et al. (2001) identified a perceptually uniform gloss space defined by two axes where the c-axis corresponds to a nonlinear combination of ρs and ρd and the d-axis corresponds to 1 − α. In the present study, we tested the responses of gloss-selective neurons to stimuli in the perceptual gloss space defined by the c- and d-axes. We found that gloss-selective neurons systematically changed their responses in the perceptual gloss space, and the distribution of the tuning directions of the population of gloss-selective neurons is biased toward directions in which perceived gloss increases. We also found that a set of perceptual gloss parameters as well as surface albedo can be well explained by the population activities of gloss-selective neurons, and that these parameters are likely encoded by the gloss-selective neurons in this area of the STS to represent various glosses. These results thus provide evidence that the IT cortex represents perceptual gloss space.",The inferior temporal (IT) cortex in the monkey brain represents perceptual gloss space.,question,1512,88.0

10030,does high frequency music have an effect on you?,When tension is exciting: an EEG exploration of excitement in music,"Music powerfully affects people’s emotions. In particular, moments of tension and deviation in musical features, including frequency, pitch, and rhythm (known as a Drop), are associated with positive emotions. However, the neuro-correlates of Drops emotive effects have never been explored. Thirty-six participants listened to music pieces containing a Drop, while undergoing continuous EEG, and rated felt excitement. Source reconstruction of EEG data showed significantly different activity in five brain regions before and after Drops: pre- and post-central gyri (PreCG and PostCG), and precuneus (PCUN) were more active before Drops and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) were more active after Drops. Importantly, activity in the IFG and MFG showed a strong correlation with subjective excitement ratings during Drop apprehension. These results suggest expectancy is important to the induction of musical emotions, in agreement with the ITPRA theory. Specifically, when Drops are expected but do not occur immediately, moderate tension is induced. Strong positive emotions then ensue when expected deviations finally occur, due to contrastive valence. This is reflected in significant brain activity for regions associated with high arousing, pleasurable emotions, such as excitement.","Moments of tension and deviation in musical features, like frequency, are associated with positive emotions and excitement, as reflected in significant brain activity.",question,1319,167.0
5607,why screen can affect eyesight,"Viewing 3D TV over two months produces no discernible effects on balance, coordination or eyesight","Abstract With the rise in stereoscopic 3D media, there has been concern that viewing stereoscopic 3D (S3D) content could have long-term adverse effects, but little data are available. In the first study to address this, 28 households who did not currently own a 3D TV were given a new TV set, either S3D or 2D. The 116 members of these households all underwent tests of balance, coordination and eyesight, both before they received their new TV set, and after they had owned it for 2 months. We did not detect any changes which appeared to be associated with viewing 3D TV. We conclude that viewing 3D TV does not produce detectable effects on balance, coordination or eyesight over the timescale studied. Practitioner Summary: Concern has been expressed over possible long-term effects of stereoscopic 3D (S3D). We looked for any changes in vision, balance and coordination associated with normal home S3D TV viewing in the 2 months after first acquiring a 3D TV. We find no evidence of any changes over this timescale.","Viewing 3D TV for two months does not produce detectable effects on balance, coordination, or eyesight.",question,1020,103.0

In the elevated plus-maze test, exposure to coffee volatiles increased the time spent in and the number of entries into the open arms without increasing spontaneous locomotor activity. Pentobarbital-induced sleep time was prolonged by volatile exposure. No significant effects were detected in the open-field or forced-swim tests.

Since the 1980s Taiwan has also been developing its own semiconductor industry, and, after twenty years of efforts, has become one of the world's major exporters of semiconductor products. Therefore, in order to position Taiwan in relation to other countries in terms of competitive advantage as defined by technology and industrial development, we need to better understand developmental trends of semiconductor technology of major competing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. By doing this we can further provide our government with additional strategic development proposals. In this study, we used a combination of patents, data mining methods (multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, and K-means clustering) to explore competing technological and strategic group relationships within the semiconductor industry in the Asia-Pacific region.

18136,does magnesium help with sleep?,Magnesium oxide supplements for the treatment of post-chemotherapy sleep disturbance.,"175Background: While every cancer patient suffers from anxiety and sleep disturbance during cancer treatment, many physicians do not recognize that these problems can continue long after treatment has ended. Many cancer patients feel increased anxiety immediately after treatment ends when they find themselves “on their own,” without the protection of the medical armamentarium. The fear of recurrence, uncertainty about the future, a sense of vulnerability, awareness of mortality, and grief for the loss of a disease-free life all contribute to anxiety and sleep disturbance long term. Magnesium has been used for sleep induction and relaxation for centuries. The primary mechanism by which sleep is enhanced is by muscle relaxation. Magnesium induces muscle relaxation by preventing calcium from binding to troponin, parvalbumin, myosin, and calmodulin, thereby blocking muscle contraction. High levels of free magnesium competitively bind these proteins, and the slow dissociation of bound magnesium provides prolon...","Magnesium has been used for sleep induction and relaxation for centuries, primarily by inducing muscle relaxation.",question,1023,114.0
24108,can vacuum sealing preserve nutrients?,The influence of vacuum-assisted closure on inflammatory tissue reactions in the postoperative course of ankle fractures,"Summary Vacuum-assisted closure (vacuum sealing) is a surgical procedure for the local treatment of severe soft-tissue damage. However, systemic consequences to the host are unknown. The aim of this study was to disclose the effects of vacuum sealing on the host's immune response and to demonstrate the early time course of endotoxin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, transferrin, orosomucoid, 6-keto-prostaglandin (6KPG), α 1 -antitrypsin and complement C3 and C4. A total of 35 patients with closed ankle fractures were randomized into two groups and operated on within 6 h after injury. After osteosynthesis, one group was treated by vacuum sealing (VS) and the other by immediate skin closure (IS). Blood was collected immediately after admission and regularly up to 96 h after surgery. Morbidity was checked during the first year after injury. Preoperative endotoxin plasma level was increased compared with that of voluntary individuals (0.06 ± 0.02 EU/ml versus 0.021 ± 0.001 EU/ml) and peaked in patients with immediate skin suture 0.5 h after the surgical procedure at 0.11 ± 0.03 EU/ml. However, in patients with vacuum sealing, this peak was absent (0.07 ± 0.02 EU/ml). Endotoxaemia decreased to almost normal values after 24 h. Plasma IL-6 peaked 12 h postoperatively, decreasing thereafter with no difference between the groups. The plasma level of 6KPG decreased immediately after the surgical procedure in vacuum-sealed patients (before operation, 415 pg/ml; 12 h later, 251 pg/ml), but increased first in patients with immediate skin suture. CRP peaked 48 h after injury (VS, 48 ± 6 mg/l; IS, 38 ± 7 mg/l) with no difference between the groups. Transferrin decreased postoperatively (pre-op: VS, 2.49 ± 0.14 g/l; IS, 2.85 ± 0.19 g/l; 24 h: VS, 2.16 ± 0.08 g/l and IS 2.33 ± 0.11 g/l), whereas haptoglobin (pre-op: VS, 2 ± 0.21 g/l; IS, 1.7 ± 0.18 g/l; 96 h: VS, 3.4 ± 0.25 g/l, IS, 3.2 ± 0.24 g/l) and orosomucoid (pre-op: VS, 0.85 ± 0.05 g/l, IS, 0.83 ± 0.07 g/l; 96 h: VS, 0.85 ± 0.05 g/l, IS 1.14 ± 0.08 g/l) increased until day 4 with no significant difference between VS and IS. There was no relevant intergroup difference for complement C3, C4, α 1 -antitrypsin and morbidity (VS/IS: wound infection, 1/1; metal loosening, 1/1; prolonged healing, 1/0; prolonged pain, 3/2; and motor disturbance, 1/1). Surgery for ankle fractures is associated with temporary endotoxaemia and substantial changes in acute-phase proteins.

16923,does legal abortion reduce crime rates?,Abortion and Crime: Cross-Country Evidence from Europe,"The publication of Donohue and Levitt (2001)’s paper on the impact of legalized abortion on the decline of crime in the US has created a wide debate in the literature. However, the vast majority of papers have been implemented in the US setting, and the few other works were single-country studies. In this research, we aim to provide new evidence on the abortion-crime link by examining this issue using a sample of 16 Western European countries. The cross-country investigation allows the exploitation of the different dates of abortion legalization in Europe. We perform regressions of crime rates on different measurements of abortion especially the share of aborted adults, defined as the accumulation of aborted children in the past that would have become adults. We find that abortion rate has a significant and negative impact on crime rates, specifically, homicide and theft. We also observe support for the impact of legalization of abortion on the reduction of crime when considering different calculations of the accumulation of abortions based on different criteria for the legalization of abortion. Thus, our results are consistent with the findings of Donohue and Levitt (2001) for the US.","Legalized abortion has a significant and negative impact on crime rates, specifically homicide and theft, in 16 Western European countries.",question,1204,139.0

Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is applied to check the stationary of variables. It is hypothesized that increase in crime leads to less economic growth in Pakistan. Autoregressive Distributive lag (ARDL) to cointegration is used to find short and long run relationship between crime and Economic growth. Results reveal that crime has negative and significant impact on economic growth in the long run, whereas in short run the effect of crime on economic growth is negative but insignificant.

This article argues that evidence is politically mobilised to legitimise the reproduction of racial and social advantage and construct racialised groups as targets for policy intervention. It is suggested that migration and education policy is refracted through a politically generated concern about the destabilising impact of new global flows of people; that this involves the construction of a new racial settlement; and that this racial settlement is articulated through a strategy of managing internal and external populations. Despite the weight of evidence in relation to the educational experience of minoritised communities, which demonstrates that racism is endemic and systemic, government‐sponsored policy interventions continue to reproduce White middle‐class racial and social advantage. Attempts to construct a discursive distinction between old and new migrations have simply made the situation worse. They have led to a failure to learn lessons from the history of racism and oppression faced by other minoritised groups. It means that the potential of the concept of institutional racism, so hard won, has not been used to understand the experience of new migrant communities. The conclusion is that the British education system is institutionally racist.","The article argues that despite evidence of racism in education, government-sponsored policy interventions continue to reproduce White middle-class racial and social advantage.",question,1486,176.0
3063,which kpis to evaluate strategic planning tools?,Strategic tools: an empirical investigation into strategy in practice in the UK,"At the core of strategic planning has been the use of strategic tools and frameworks such as the ubiquitous SWOT analysis and a variety of frameworks bearing Michael Porter's moniker. There has been a tendency for generic tools to be developed and disseminated to industry, with a one-type-fits-all approach. 
 
 
Planning and the use of tools have largely been dismissed in much contemporary, particularly European practice-based, strategic literature. This paper argues that the use of strategic tools has a place in contemporary strategic management. However, the traditional prescriptive rationale for strategic frameworks is replaced with a practice-based set of reasons advocating the use of strategic tools. 
 
 
The paper advocates the use of strategic tools in a variety of strategic contexts including planning. However, it is shown that groupings of strategic tool usage can be identified which might indicate that business and business schools should reconsider how they apply, learn and disseminate strategic framework.

The regulatory effect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) has no significant impact on director turnover and the percentage of losses in directorships, although directors lose a significant number of directorships. But, the directors at FR firms bear the reputation costs of abnormal turnovers and high percentages of losses in directorship in relation to the directors at non-FR firms in the post-SOX era.

15521,Do you need to hit failure to stimulate muscle hypertrophy?,Energy Metabolism in Exercise-Induced Physiologic Cardiac Hypertrophy,"Physiologic hypertrophy of the heart preserves or enhances systolic function without interstitial fibrosis or cell death. As a unique form of physiological stress, regular exercise training can trigger the adaptation of cardiac muscle to cause physiological hypertrophy, partly due to its ability to improve cardiac metabolism. In heart failure (HF), cardiac dysfunction is closely associated with early initiation of maladaptive metabolic remodeling. A large amount of clinical and experimental evidence shows that metabolic homeostasis plays an important role in exercise training, which is conducive to the treatment and recovery of cardiovascular diseases. Potential mechanistic targets for modulation of cardiac metabolism have become a hot topic at present. Thus, exploring the energy metabolism mechanism in exercise-induced physiologic cardiac hypertrophy may produce new therapeutic targets, which will be helpful to design novel effective strategies. In this review, we summarize the changes of myocardial metabolism (fatty acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and mitochondrial adaptation), metabolically-related signaling molecules, and probable regulatory mechanism of energy metabolism during exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy.","Regular exercise training can trigger the adaptation of cardiac muscle to cause physiological hypertrophy, partly due to its ability to improve cardiac metabolism.",question,1263,163.0

18820,does myopia caused by inflammation of the gut microbiome,Proinflammatory status in the aqueous humor of high myopic cataract eyes.,"High myopia has long been recognized as an inflammation-related disease, and high myopic eyes are thought to have a proinflammatory internal microenvironment, which might predispose to the occurrence of certain inflammation-related complications such as fibrotic capsular contraction syndrome after cataract surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to detect inflammatory cytokines expressed in the aqueous humor (AH) of high myopic cataract (HMC) patients. The cytokines were screened using a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array in AH samples from 15 age-related cataract (ARC) patients and 15 HMC patients. Those detected by the screening assays were verified using a Bio-Plex Suspension Array System in AH samples from 35 ARC patients and 45 HMC patients. The cytokine antibody array showed that the expression level of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the AH was higher in ARC than in HMC, whereas opposite trends were found for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), IL-8, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and IL-6 (all P < 0.05). In the verification assay using the suspension cytokine array, only the expression levels of IL-1ra and MCP-1 were significantly different between the ARC and HMC groups (P = 0.014 and 0.038, respectively); these results were confirmed by western blot assays. Our results demonstrated that the expression of IL-1ra was significantly lower and the expression of MCP-1 was significantly higher in the AH of HMC than in ARC, suggestive of a proinflammatory status in the anterior chamber of HMC eyes.","High myopic cataract eyes have a proinflammatory status in the anterior chamber, with lower IL-1ra and higher MCP-1 expression levels.",question,1646,134.0

19302,is cold immersion helpful for health,Mechanistic control of the cold-induced augmentation of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α,"Cold water immersion is commonly used to alleviate the stress and damage that ensues following strenuous exercise. Alongside its purported performance and analgesic benefits recent literature highlights the positive impact it may have towards endurance adaptive responses, particularly on key markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. Despite these recent advances showing PGC-1α, the ‘master regulator’ of mitochondrial biogenesis, being augmented in its post-exercise response by cold water immersion, the precise controlling mechanisms remain to be determined. However, it has been suggested that local cooling effects on AMPK and p38 MAPK related signalling and/or increased systemic β-adrenergic stimulation are involved. Study 1 (Chapter 4) examined whether post-exercise cold-water immersion induced augmentation of PGC-1α mRNA is mediated through local or systemic mechanisms. Participants completed acute cycling followed by seated-rest (CON) or single-leg cold-water immersion (CWI; 10 min, 8°C) with muscle biopsies obtained pre-, post- and 3 h post-exercise from a single limb in the CON condition but from both limbs in CWI (thereby providing tissue from a CWI and non-immersed limb, NOT). Muscle temperature decreased following CWI (-5°C), with lesser changes observed in CON and NOT (-3°C; P<0.05). A significant interaction effect was present for AMPK phosphorylation (P=0.031). Exercise (CON) increased gene expression of PGC-1α 3 h post-exercise (~5-fold; P<0.001). Post-exercise CWI augmented PGC-1α expression above CON in immersed (CWI; ~9-fold; P=0.003) and NOT limbs (~12-fold; P=0.001). Plasma Normetanephrine concentration was higher in CWI vs. CON post-immersion (860 vs. 665 pmol·L-1; P=0.034). Data herein reports for the first time that local cooling of the immersed limb evokes transcriptional control of PGC1-α in the non-immersed limb, suggesting increased systemic β-adrenergic activation of AMPK may mediate, in part, post-exercise cold-induction of PGC-1α mRNA. Study 2 (Chapter 5) assessed the impact of combining a post-exercise cooling stimulus with prior low glycogen as both stressors are shown to separately enhance the post-exercise PGC-1α response. A single-leg depletion protocol and bi-lateral muscle biopsies with and without post-exercise CWI were utilised to give the following conditions: High glycogen control (HI CON), Low glycogen control (LO CON), High glycogen CWI (HI CWI) and Low glycogen CWI (LO CWI). HI limbs began the experimental day ~190 mmol·kg-1dry weight (dw) with low limbs at ~85 mmol·kg-1dw glycogen before undergoing the same relative exercise protocol as Chapter 4. PGC-1α mRNA was different between conditions (P = 0.039) with HI glycogen limbs showing greater expression than contralateral LO glycogen limbs (P < 0.05). PGC-1α mRNA increased to a greater extent in CWI HI vs. CON HI (ES 0.67 Large). Data herein supports previous research that shows post-exercise CWI is able to augment PGC-1α above the exercise response alone, however this response was not evident in heavily depleted limbs (~85 mmol·kg-1dw), suggesting a critical threshold may exist for the expected enhancement of PGC-1α to occur when exercise is commenced in a low glycogen state. Chapter 6 sought to examine the contribution of CWI (Chapter 4, Experiment 1) and/or low muscle glycogen (Chapter 5, Experiment 2) in the activation of PGC-1α via either the canonical (Exon 1a) or the alternative promoter (Exon 1b) regions. Data was obtained using muscle biopsy samples collected from the previous chapters (Chapter 4 and 5). Exercise increased the expression of promoter specific PGC-1α, with greater fold changes seen in Exon 1b. Experiment 1 (Chapter 4) showed PGC-1α Exon 1b expression closely matched the pattern of expression seen for total-PGC-1α, with large, systemic cold-induced increases in the non-immersed (NOT, 2344 fold change from Pre, P = 0.010) and immersed (CWI, 1860 fold change from Pre, P = 0.07), compared with the control limb (CON, 579 fold change from Pre). Results from experiment 2 (Chapter 5) saw PGC-1α Exon 1a and 1b gene expression increase post-exercise, with the Exon 1b response showing lower fold-changes at 3h post-exercise compared to those from Experiment 1 (chapter 4), despite the same exercise protocol being utilised (~200 fold increases in experiment 2 vs. ~2000 fold increases in experiment 1). The data suggests that depletion exercise in the days prior to the experimental day may have raised basal RNA levels, which may have therefore contributed to dampened fold-changes seen post-exercise when relativized to pre-exercise values. The lack of a cold augmentation in promoter specific PGC-1α gene expression in experiment 2 suggests this response may be extremely acute, and may not occur when cooling is undertaken on the third day of exercise. This thesis provides a novel insight into the influence of local, systemic and upstream activating mechanisms regulating the post-exercise, post-cooling and exercising in low glycogen states upon PGC-1α. These findings provide mechanistic application for future study designs and practical application in the support for the use of CWI when the intended target is an upregulation of the gene PGC-1α.","Cold water immersion after exercise can increase PGC-1α expression, which is associated with positive endurance adaptive responses and mitochondrial biogenesis.",question,5231,160.0

Therefore, Aβ oligomer inhibitors might prevent neurodegeneration and have the potential to be developed as disease-modifying treatments of AD. However, different formation protocols of Aβ oligomer might lead to oligomers with different characteristics. Moreover, there are not many methods to effectively screen Aβ1-42 oligomer inhibitors.

15515,what is the allure of fear?,Neural correlates of fear: insights from neuroimaging,"Fear anticipates a challenge to one's well-being and is a reaction to the risk of harm. The expression of fear in the individual is a constellation of physiological, behavioral, cogni- tive, and experiential responses. Fear indicates risk and will guide adaptive behavior, yet fear is also fundamental to the symptomatology of most psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies of normal and abnormal fear in humans extend knowledge gained from animal experiments. Neuroimaging permits the empirical evaluation of theory (emotions as response tendencies, mental states, and valence and arousal dimensions), and improves our understanding of the mechanisms of how fear is controlled by both cognitive processes and bodily states. Within the human brain, fear engages a set of regions that include insula and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala, and dorsal brain-stem centers, such as periaqueductal gray matter. This same fear matrix is also implicated in attentional orienting, mental planning, interoceptive mapping, bodily feelings, novelty and motivational learning, behavioral prioritization, and the control of autonomic arousal. The stereotyped expression of fear can thus be viewed as a special construc- tion from combinations of these processes. An important motivator for understanding neural fear mechanisms is the debilitating clinical expression of anxiety. Neuroimaging studies of anxiety patients highlight the role of learning and memory in pathological fear. Posttraumatic stress disorder is further distinguished by impairment in cognitive control and contextual memory. These processes ultimately need to be targeted for symptomatic recovery. Neuroscientific knowledge of fear has broader relevance to understanding human and societal behavior. As yet, only some of the insights into fear, anxiety, and avoidance at the individual level extrapolate to groups and populations and can be meaningfully applied to economics, prejudice, and politics. Fear is ultimately a contagious social emotion.","Fear engages a set of brain regions, guiding adaptive behavior and is fundamental to the symptomatology of most psychiatric disorders.",question,2016,134.0
21571,what is corporate sociopolitical activism?,Domesticating Radical Rant and Rage: An Exploration of the Consequences of Environmental Shareholder Resolutions on Corporate Environmental Performance,"This article examines the effect of social shareholder activism on one of the most visible aspects of corporate social behavior, namely corporate pollution management practice. Social shareholder activism is a distinct form of social movement that engages firms “in the suites.” We theorize the effect of social shareholder activism using three social movement mechanisms: (a) disruption of routines, (b) reframing of issues using extant institutional logics, and (c) mobilization of relevant third-party constituents. Our empirical analysis using 13-year panel data of 58 public corporations strongly confirm the positive effect of environmental shareholder resolutions on the targeted firm’s pollution management practice. We have also found that certain firms targeted by social shareholder activism are more likely to respond positively to the demands than others. In particular, firms that can potentially incur higher disruption costs and are more dependent on reputation for critical resources such as larger firms as well as firms in industries that are closer to end-user consumers are more likely to concede to the demands from shareholder activists.","Social shareholder activism positively affects targeted firms' pollution management practices, especially in larger firms and those closer to end-user consumers.",question,1160,161.0
2679,can humans overcome cognitive bias,The Role of Perceptual Bias in Estimating Quantities,"A cognitive bias refers to a systematic (that is - a non-random and, thus, predictable) deviation from rationality in judgment or decision-making (Blanco, 2017). This implies that humans tend to deviate from the traditional concept of the ‘homo-economicus’ and can thus be irrational. They can pick an option that defies rational logic as they presume it to be the ‘correct’ option.<br><br>This paper focuses on the existence of one such bias - The Perceptual Bias, which explains how people tend to associate the height of a glass with the quantity of liquid it holds. In other words, a tall glass creates an illusion of greater quantity than a glass that is shorter and wider but holds the same quantity. People associate parameters of the glass, such as the quantity it holds, based on sensory inputs, such as sight. This paper also shows that when a tall glass and a short glass are presented individually, the bias is observed, however, when shown together to the same person, it spawns the idea of a comparison, and the effect of the perceptual bias is no longer observed.","Perceptual bias can be overcome when a comparison is made between two options, as it reduces the effect of the bias.",question,1078,116.0
20687,"does sharing economy platforms often rely on user-generated content, such as reviews and ratings, to",Customer Value in the Sharing Economy Platform: The Airbnb Case,"The sharing economy is a platform-based business model in which users are directly connected for creation, sharing, and exchange of goods or services that draw on underused resources. While this emerging phenomenon has been studied from several perspectives, including the technical, social, and economic, limited investigation has been conducted from the customer perspective. A study was carried out to narrow this research gap by applying the customer viewpoint to explore and analyse how the sharing economy reconfigures value creation. To reach the goal for this research, an interpretive approach was taken to the case of Airbnb. Customers’ experiences of using the sharing economy were examined to disentangle the economic, functional, emotional, and symbolic benefits and sacrifices that together capture the diversity of customer-perceived value of the sharing economy. Customer value is discussed as an important conceptual tool to identify and pinpoint the distinguishing characteristics of the sharing economy and to explore how conventional businesses and emerging sharing-economy platforms can recognise and capitalise on their competitive advantages. While the sharing economy gives customers alternatives that involve easier consumption methods at lower cost, it also provides a unique, personal, and socially integrated experience. This can contribute to values that extend beyond traditional hospitality management and thus imbue sharing-economy platforms with a unique and sustainable competitive advantage.","Sharing economy platforms like Airbnb provide unique, personal, and socially integrated experiences, contributing to values beyond traditional hospitality management.",question,1526,166.0

Members of the skills-based classes engaged in activities that aimed to cultivate perspective-taking, empathy, and compassion; members of the contact classes met with Jewish-Israeli peers; and members of the control group engaged in a general social studies program. Outcomes were measured a week before, immediately after, and 6 months following completion of the program. Results showed that the effects of both interventions were significantly larger than of those of the control group; both interventions increased readiness for contact with, and decreased emotional prejudice, expectations about negative outgroup behaviors, and stereotyping of Jewish-Israeli peers.","Intergroup contact decreases emotional prejudice, negative expectations, and stereotyping.",question,964,90.0
6626,effect of decriminalization of drugs,"Cannabis use among U.S. adolescents in the era of marijuana legalization: a review of changing use patterns, comorbidity, and health correlates","Abstract Decriminalization, medicalization, and legalization of cannabis use by a majority of U.S. states over the past 25 years have dramatically shifted societal perceptions and use patterns among Americans. How marijuana policy changes have affected population-wide health of U.S. youth and what the downstream public health implications of marijuana legalization are topics of significant debate. Cannabis remains the most commonly used federally illicit psychoactive drug by U.S. adolescents and is the main drug for which U.S. youth present for substance use treatment. Converging evidence indicates that adolescent-onset cannabis exposure is associated with short- and possibly long-term impairments in cognition, worse academic/vocational outcomes, and increased prevalence of psychotic, mood, and addictive disorders. Odds of negative developmental outcomes are increased in youth with early-onset, persistent, high frequency, and high-potency Δ-9-THC cannabis use, suggesting dose-dependent relationships. Cannabis use disorders are treatable conditions with clear childhood antecedents that respond to targeted prevention and early intervention strategies. This review indicates that marijuana policy changes have had mixed effects on U.S. adolescent health including potential benefits from decriminalization and negative health outcomes evidenced by increases in cannabis-related motor vehicle accidents, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Federal and state legislatures should apply a public health framework and consider the possible downstream effects of marijuana policy change on paediatric health.","Marijuana policy changes have had mixed effects on U.S. adolescent health, including potential benefits from decriminalization and negative health outcomes like increased cannabis-related accidents and hospitalizations.",phrase,1632,219.0

This research used questionnaires which distributed to the respondents and the data obtained were processed quantitatively with path analysis. The results showed that the significance influence of leadership on the lecturer only accounted for 1.4%, while the effect of self-efficacy of the student is very significant on the students’ achievement motivation, which amounted to 84.5%.

18624,the relationship between sleep environment and insomnia,The influence of personality and dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions on the severity of insomnia,"Previous findings suggest that personality traits and dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions may perpetuate insomnia, but findings concerning this have been scarce. Thus, we hypothesized that personality and sleep-related cognitions influence the severity of insomnia, and investigated the association personality and sleep-related cognitions had with various sleep-related parameters, including severity of insomnia. Forty-four patients with psychophysiological insomnia were assessed using The Temperament and Character Inventory, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Dysfunctional Belief and Attitudes toward Sleep Scale, the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Insomnia severity was significantly and positively correlated with harm avoidance, self-transcendence and sleep-related cognitions, and negatively correlated with novelty seeking, reward dependence, and cooperativeness. Dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions were positively correlated with insomnia severity and sleep quality. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that sleep-related cognitions, depression and reward dependence scores were significant determinants of insomnia severity, and that sleep-related cognitions and self-transcendence were significant positive determinants of sleep quality. Reward dependence, depression and sleep-related cognitions were associated with insomnia severity, and comparison with previous findings implied that 'internalizing behavior' and depression may be more plausible candidates for the link between personality and insomnia than anxiety. Considering the major role of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) in the treatment of insomnia, assessment of these factors and management of sleep-related cognitions may help alleviate symptoms in patients with insomnia.","Insomnia severity is significantly correlated with sleep-related cognitions, depression, and reward dependence scores.",phrase,1877,118.0
8340,what do people need to be happy?,Values of happiness,"How people conceive of happiness reveals much about who they are and the values they hold dear. The modern conception of happiness as private good feeling is the result of a long sequence of changes in dominant conceptions of the ends of life and of humanity’s place in the cosmos. This invites reflection on how the very vagueness of happiness can account for its powerful claim to render diverse values commensurable. In arguing for the importance of a critical, ethnographic approach to happiness— one concerned less with gauging how happy people are than with how happiness figures as an idea, mood, or motive in everyday life—we highlight its relationship to values, as well as questions of scope, virtue, and responsibility. Whether real or elusive, the pursuit of happiness structures time in specific ways and is largely other-oriented, insofar as one’s own happiness would seem best left in the hands of others.","The pursuit of happiness is largely other-oriented, and its conception reveals individuals' values and their understanding of life's purpose.",question,920,141.0

Once the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis was made, the patient was successfully treated with subcutaneous antihelminthic drugs. With appropriate screening for and eradication of strongyloides in those with immune compromise, or in those about to start immunosuppressive therapy, potentially fatal episodes of hyperinfection could be avoided. In the absence of screening, severe strongyloidiasis should be suspected in immunosuppressed individuals who have travelled to or resided in an endemic area and present with the characteristic features.

In addition, a negative phenomenon that is widespread in social networks and infringes on human rights, fake news and hate speech on social networks is investigated. Combining qualitative discourse analysis, comparison and description, the study shows that the role of citizen journalism is growing in many countries. However, hate speech and fake news on social media hinder the development of citizen journalism. To this end, further legislative and democratic measures must be taken.

5573,challenges to girls education,"Girls first! Promoting early education in Tibetan areas of China, a case study","This study explores conditions promoting girls' education in ethnic Tibetan pastoral highlands of the Qinghai‐Tibet plateau of western China. Global discourse and cross national evidence on the transgenerational benefits of girls' education has shown prioritizing girls' education to be the most effective strategy of breaking the vicious cycle of poverty, a crucial policy strategy for this comparatively declining region. The study looks beyond utilitarian concerns as it examines the situation of girls within the network of relationships that (1) bind them in their traditional place, and (2) create new spaces for their educational empowerment. Based on rich qualitative data narrating girls' pursuit of education the author concluded that girls were advantageously situated for primary schooling, that schools functioned as change agents that opened up spaces of possibility for girls, including their demand for parity in promotion to secondary and higher schooling. Male adults leaving for work in the modern money economy and the rising demand for secondary education placed Tibetan girls even in remote settings into a modern habitus as they acquired a modern subjectivity – though they remained materially locked in a pre‐modern terrain and declining socio‐economic conditions. The author argues that taking a critical empowerment perspective in exploring socio‐economic as well as cultural conditions as changeable allows us to see beyond grim developmentalist predictions of vicious‐circles and find the seeds of change. Thus deeper understanding enables policy makers to formulate culturally responsive policies that have the salutary effects of expanding human liberties. The article concludes with a series of recommendations for improving girls' education.","Girls' primary schooling in Tibetan areas of China is positively impacted by male adults leaving for work and the rising demand for secondary education, creating new spaces for educational empowerment.",phrase,1773,201.0

Introduction: One of the aims outlined in Malaysia’s Health Vision 2020 is to be a nation of healthy individuals, families, and communities through an equitable, affordable, efficient, environmentally adaptable, and consumer friendly healthcare system. Sabah faces tremendous challenges to provide the best care for patients. For example, Sabah's unique geographical location and landscape, such as steep hills and rivers, is one of the challenges that health staff faces. Objectives of this study aimed to examine the prevalence of geographical accessibility, types of healthcare services, and the types of health seeking behaviour in 2 northern rural areas of Sabah to assess the geographic accessibility and availability of healthcare services. Materials and Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two rural areas in Sabah—Kudat and Pitas. Data collection was done by using questionnaire and face–to-face interviews. Results: It was found that 48% of the study population sought healthcare and they mainly chose healthcare services from hospitals and health clinics. Conclusion: Half of the population in the areas studied used healthcare in the last year. The choice of using a public hospital or community health clinics was determined by distance from residence.","Half of the population in rural Sabah used healthcare in the last year, with the choice of public hospitals or community health clinics determined by distance from residence.",question,1298,174.0
9237,Do masks reduce transmission of COVID?,Slight reduction in SARS-CoV-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation,"Masks are a vital tool for limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population. Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in masking relative to current levels would reduce the reproductive number substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks that reduce transmission risk by 50% will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who do get infected, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy is only effective for this indication as post-exposure prophylaxis, specifically if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.","Masks substantially reduce the probability of COVID transmission, even if they only lower exposure viral load by about 50%.",question,1513,123.0

17041,does high intensity training help lose body fat?,"Changes in body composition with a hypocaloric high-protein diet combined with sedentary, moderate and high-intense physical activity in overweight or obese males: a 6-month randomized controlled trial","Objectives

Although the effectiveness of high-intensity training has been widely recognized as positive in athletes, its application in a clinical context is not well established. There is enough evidence to confirm that high-intensity routines are safe and that at-risk populations, such as for overweight and obese subjects, can help from these weight loss treatments. The purpose of this study was to lead a trial to test whether manipulation of physical activity in extension to high protein diet intake would induce changes in total weight and body composition.
Methods

Sixty-eight healthy male volunteers were randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups: a control group with a low-level prescription of physical activity (1–4 METs), moderate physical activity group that performed 10.000 steps walking per day (5–8 METs) and intense physical activity group that trained exercises by at least 70% of VO2max three times a week (> 8 METs). All subjects followed a high-protein diet designed with a reduction of 500 kcal/day. Nutritional counseling was provided throughout the study period to help ensure dietary adherence. This intervention was delivered over twenty-four sessions as weekly one-on-one, face-to-face 30-min consultations.
Results

A significant reduction in body fat percentage was observed in the intense physical activity group (-20.9 ± 8.8 (CI95%: -25.6 – -16.2), p < 0.001). The change in muscle mass did not produce any significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). Concerning weight, a notable weight loss was found in those subjects who performed moderate or intense physical exercise, vs. those who did light exercise, (p < 0.001) and (p < 0.003), respectively.

10979,what are the effects of swimming on human longevity?,Swimming‐related effects on cerebrovascular and cognitive function,"Both acute and regular exercise influence vascular and cognitive function. Upright aquatic exercise increases mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAvmean) and has been suggested as favorable for cerebrovascular adaptations. However, MCAvmean has not been reported during swimming. Thus, we examined the cerebrovascular and cognitive effects of swimming. Ten land‐based athletes (22 ± 5 years) and eight swimmers (19 ± 1 years) completed three cognitive tasks and four conditions that were used to independently and collectively delineate the swimming‐related factors (i.e., posture, immersion, CO2 retention [end‐tidal CO2; PETCO2], and motor involvement). Measurements of MCAvmean and PETCO2 were taken throughout each condition. Prone posture increased MCAvmean by 11% (P < 0.01 vs. upright land). Water immersion independently increased MCAvmean when upright (12%; P < 0.01) but not prone (P = 0.76). The consequent rise in PETCO2 during head‐out, breast‐stroke swimming (50% heart rate range) independently increased MCAvmean by 14% (P < 0.01), while the motor involvement of swimming per se did not significantly change MCAvmean (P = 0.32). While accounting for sex, swimmers had ~17% lower MCAvmean during all rest conditions (P ≤ 0.05). However, in a subset of participants, both groups had similar internal carotid artery diameters (P = 0.99) and velocities (P = 0.97). Water immersion per se did not alter cognition (P ≥ 0.15), but 20 min of moderate‐intensity swimming improved visuomotor performance by 4% (P = 0.03), regardless of athlete group (P = 0.12). In conclusion, breast‐stroke swimming increased MCAvmean mostly due to postural and PETCO2 effects, with minimal contributions from water immersion or motor activity. Lastly, swimming improved cognitive functioning acutely, regardless of athlete group. Future research should explore the chronic effects of swimming on cerebrovascular function and cognition, particularly in aging.","Swimming improved cognitive functioning acutely, regardless of athlete group.",question,1959,77.0

It affects diet, nutrition, employment, housing, self-concept, and the entire educational experience. Ironically, Americans have always looked to education as a means of breaking the seemingly endless cycle of poverty. But rather than serve as a great ladder carrying all who climb with concerted effort to social and economic equality, current research suggests some educational structures may actually limit opportunities for certain children. This paper focuses on education in American society and how it may influence inequality . It addresses the question of why students from various social classes differ significantly in academic achievement and it critiques the major theoretical explanations for this difference. Finally, it supports the idea that specific educational structures perpetuate the cycle of poverty by determining educational outcomes and limiting the economic life chances of children. One such educational structure, tracking, or separation by ability, is the focus of this paper. Tracking is a reality in the American school system. Considerable research has revealed class, gender, and race biases with less-advantaged children more often placed in the lower tracks. This paper examines tracking on a national and international basis. It explores various processes within the tracks that limit a child's development and, in turn, have an impact on future economic opportunities.

These dimensions refer to the overall degree of religiosity, the specific impact of different religions, religious competition or the proximity between religion and the state. The empirical test makes use of the largest available cross-section on the size of the shadow economy and matches this dataset with numerous religious indicators. Summary measures of general religiosity or indicators of religious competition do not have a measurable impact. However, robust differences emerge across religions. Countries dominated by Islam or Eastern religions are associated with smaller shadow economies compared to Christian countries. Furthermore, the proximity between state and religion matters. Close ties between both are typical for smaller shadow economies.

Acknowledging this, businesses are beginning to make commitments to account for and mitigate their influence on biodiversity and report this in sustainability reports. We assessed the top 100 of the 2016 Fortune 500 Global companies' (the Fortune 100) sustainability reports to gauge the current state of corporate biodiversity accountability. Almost half (49) of the Fortune 100 mentioned biodiversity in reports, and 31 made clear biodiversity commitments, of which only 5 were specific, measureable, and time bound. A variety of biodiversity‐related activities were disclosed (e.g., managing impacts, restoring biodiversity, and investing in biodiversity), but only 9 companies provided quantitative indicators to verify the magnitude of their activities (e.g., area of habitat restored). No companies reported quantitative biodiversity outcomes, making it difficult to determine whether business actions were of sufficient magnitude to address impacts and were achieving positive outcomes for nature. Conservation science can advance approaches to corporate biodiversity accountability by helping businesses make science‐based biodiversity commitments, develop meaningful indicators, and select more targeted activities to address business impacts.

17212,effect of cbm on cognitive biases,Modifying cognitive errors promotes cognitive well being: a new approach to bias modification.,"BACKGROUND
Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) procedures have been used to train individuals to interpret ambiguous information in a negative or benign direction and have provided evidence that negative biases causally contribute to emotional vulnerability.


METHOD
Here we present the development and validation of a new form of CBM designed to manipulate the cognitive errors known to characterize both depression and anxiety. Our manipulation was designed to modify the biased cognitions identified by Beck's cognitive error categories (e.g. arbitrary inference, overgeneralisation) and typically targeted during therapy.


RESULTS
In a later test of spontaneous inferences, unselected (Experiment 1) and vulnerable participants (Experiment 2) who had generated positive alternatives rather than errors perceived novel hypothetical events, their causes and outcomes in a non-distorted manner. These groups were also less vulnerable to two different types of emotional stressor (video clips; and an imagined social situation). Furthermore participants' interpretation of their own performance on a problem-solving task was improved by the manipulation, despite actual performance showing no significant change.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings demonstrate that Cognitive Error Modification can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress and improve self-perceptions of performance.","CBM can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress, and improve self-perceptions of performance.",phrase,1396,113.0

Therefore a review of the nature of informational continuity is useful.


AIM
To answer the question 'How is informational continuity developed in general practice?'.


DESIGN OF STUDY
A rigorous systematic review of relevant electronic databases.


METHOD
Databases were searched for articles answering the research question. Articles focused on family medicine and informational continuity of care were included. Data from reviewed articles were independently extracted and reviewed by two researchers. Conceptual and evidence-based articles were included.


RESULTS
Initially, 193 articles were obtained from all five bibliographic databases; 57 were retained following title and abstract review. Of these, 34 articles were included in the final systematic review. Results show that informational continuity of care is developed using paper/electronic records and remembered information collectively, through a series of doctor-patient consultations over time. Obstacles to its development are practitioners not recording patient information and patients not disclosing important details.


CONCLUSION
These findings have implications for newer styles of primary care that may have a negative impact in the successful management of chronic illnesses in particular.","Informational continuity of care is crucial for managing chronic illnesses, but newer primary care styles may negatively impact its development.",phrase,1604,144.0
19493,the relationship between social media use and school performance.,Data Mining Techniques to Analyze the Impact of Social Media on Academic Performance of High School Students,"The main purpose of educational institutions is to provide quality education to their students. However, it is difficult to analyze large data manually. Educational data mining is more effective as compared to statistical methods used to explore data in educational settings to analyze students’ performance. The objective of the study is to use different data mining techniques and find their performance and impact of different features on students’ academic performance. The dataset was collected from the Kaggle repository. To analyze the dataset, different classification algorithms were applied like decision tree, random forest, SVM classifier, SGD classifier, AdaBoost classifier, and LR classifier. This research revealed that random forest achieved a higher score (98%). The score of decision tree, AdaBoost, logistic regression, SVM, and SGD is 90%, 89%, 88%, 86%, and 84%, respectively.

9069,effects of communication of parents to student academic achievement,Quality Matters More Than Quantity: Parent–Child Communication and Adolescents’ Academic Performance,"This study examined the effects of parent–child communication, including the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these communications, on young American adolescents’ academic performance by using an Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten dataset. We considered children’s self-concept a mediator in examining the effects. Structural equation modeling was used for evaluating the model. The results revealed that the quality of parent–child communication was positively associated with these children’s academic performance, and this association can be mediated by the adolescents’ self-concept. However, the quantity of parent–child communication did not show a direct or an indirect association with the adolescents’ academic achievements. These findings suggest that efforts to improve the quality of parent–child communication and to strengthen the connection between high-quality communications and adolescents’ self-concept may benefit young adolescents’ academic development.","Quality of parent-child communication positively affects academic performance, mediated by the adolescents' self-concept.",phrase,994,121.0

Thus, organizations spend more attention on the protection of knowledge and also research on knowledge protection has gained increasing attention in the past years. However, knowledge protection research mainly focuses on the design of preventive measures and little is published about real incidents or reactive measures. Learning from failure and from incidents is important to improve current practice. This paper reflects on four cases of real knowledge risk incidents. We discuss ways to prevent or delay knowledge spillovers and the importance of knowing the threats in order to prevent them.

Researchers discuss food insecurity as one of the leading causes of mental distress. The onset and continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic appear to compound food insecurity, economic hardship, and mental health. This study aims to understand the mental health of college students in relation to food insecurity and financial struggles to meet basic living expenses and debts during the pandemic. Authors collected survey data from college students in a public urban university in 2020 and conducted a multiple regression (N = 375). Evidence indicated that mental health became significantly worse after the pandemic onset. Mental health was significantly associated with food insecurity and multiple economic hardships, controlling for prepandemic mental health and other characteristics. The findings affirm that food insecurity and dire levels of economic hardship have devastating effects on the mental health of young adults.

7407,does artificial intelligence affect recruitment processes?,Even good bots fight: The case of Wikipedia,"In recent years, there has been a huge increase in the number of bots online, varying from Web crawlers for search engines, to chatbots for online customer service, spambots on social media, and content-editing bots in online collaboration communities. The online world has turned into an ecosystem of bots. However, our knowledge of how these automated agents are interacting with each other is rather poor. Bots are predictable automatons that do not have the capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality and it is hence natural to expect interactions between bots to be relatively predictable and uneventful. In this article, we analyze the interactions between bots that edit articles on Wikipedia. We track the extent to which bots undid each other’s edits over the period 2001–2010, model how pairs of bots interact over time, and identify different types of interaction trajectories. We find that, although Wikipedia bots are intended to support the encyclopedia, they often undo each other’s edits and these sterile “fights” may sometimes continue for years. Unlike humans on Wikipedia, bots’ interactions tend to occur over longer periods of time and to be more reciprocated. Yet, just like humans, bots in different cultural environments may behave differently. Our research suggests that even relatively “dumb” bots may give rise to complex interactions, and this carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research. Understanding what affects bot-bot interactions is crucial for managing social media well, providing adequate cyber-security, and designing well functioning autonomous vehicles.","Bots may give rise to complex interactions, which carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research and its applications.",question,1641,139.0

The Problems of Policy criticizes regime analyses that try to explain major international outcomes in terms of the power of the world's leading country or hegemone. Cowhey nicely pinpoints the political reductionism of this perspective that places undue weight on the political and the structural to the detriment of the dynamic process of constant mutual adjustment that is the hallmark of markets. Cowhey also takes on neoclassical economic assumptions about the primacy of efficiency and automatic adjustments of profit-maximizing firms in markets. Instead, he finds that actual oil market outcomes vary from what the economic model would predict. How should we account for the variance? The author explains these outcomes, unanticipated by the pure economic or the pure political models, by showing us how politics shapes market structure (the number of firms and their market shares) and the way market structures mold the subsequent choices—or ""International Management Strategies""—of commercial firms and states acting as individuals and within coalitions.

11237,psychiatric benefits of intermittent fasting,The Health-Promoting Effects and the Mechanism of Intermittent Fasting,"Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern in which individuals go extended periods with little or no energy intake after consuming regular food in intervening periods. IF has several health-promoting effects. It can effectively reduce weight, fasting insulin levels, and blood glucose levels. It can also increase the antitumor activity of medicines and cause improvement in the case of neurological diseases, such as memory deficit, to achieve enhanced metabolic function and prolonged longevity. Additionally, IF activates several biological pathways to induce autophagy, encourages cell renewal, prevents cancer cells from multiplying and spreading, and delays senescence. However, IF has specific adverse effects and limitations when it comes to people of a particular age and gender. Hence, a more systematic study on the health-promoting effects and safety of IF is needed.

4186,does angiopoietin-2 promotes angiogenesis or disrupts microvasculature?,Induction of Angiogenesis and Modulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 by Simvastatin After Traumatic Brain Injury,"BACKGROUND:Our previous studies demonstrated that simvastatin reduced neuronal death, increased neurogenesis, and promoted functional recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). OBJECTIVE:To investigate the effect of simvastatin on angiogenesis after TBI and the related signaling pathways. METHODS:Saline or simvastatin (1 mg/kg) was administered orally to rats starting at day 1 after TBI or sham surgery and then daily for 14 days. Rats were sacrificed at 3 and 14 days after treatment. Brain sections and tissues were prepared for immunohistochemical staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot analysis. Cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by immunocytochemical staining with phallotoxins and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Western blot analysis was carried out to examine the simvastatin-induced activation of the v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (Akt) signaling pathway. The expression of VEGFR-2 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS:Simvastatin significantly increased the length of vascular perimeter, promoted the proliferation of endothelial cells, and improved the sensorimotor function after TBI. Simvastatin stimulated endothelial cell tube formation after oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. VEGFR-2 expression in both brain tissues and cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cells was enhanced after simvastatin treatment, which may be modulated by activation of Akt. Akt-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation was also induced by simvastatin in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION:Simvastatin augments TBI-induced angiogenesis in the lesion boundary zone and hippocampus and improves functional recovery. Simvastatin also promotes angiogenesis in vitro. These beneficial effects on angiogenesis may be related to simvastatin-induced activation of the VEGFR-2/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway.","Simvastatin augments TBI-induced angiogenesis and improves functional recovery, possibly through activation of the VEGFR-2/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway.",question,2001,179.0
21747,does fantasy in children's fantasy fiction translate to the reader's reality,"Contemporary fantasy fiction and representations of religion: playing with reality, myth and magic in His Dark Materials and Harry Potter","Often fiction and religion have been seen as separate moments or genres, but recent encounters between the two fields – such as fiction-based religions or religious controversies with regard to works of fiction – show that a thorough discussion of the religious in the fictional and the fictional in the religious is important. It may be consequential for what we understand religion to be in the study of religions today. The fantasy genre, with its other worlds, magic and superhuman characters, is extremely successful in contemporary Western popular culture. This article discusses the genre of fantasy fiction and analyses how selected examples of contemporary fantasy fiction represent and mediate religion. It argues that fantasy fiction both reflects and forms religious interests and religious fascination in contemporary society, and, in combination with the related new virtual worlds of the supernatural, fantasy fiction, that it provides sites for exploration of religion. This article is not a study of new religious movements, or of locating and analysing classically religious practitioners who use fantasy fiction in religions. Rather, the author seeks to understand the current pervasive presence of religion in fantasy fiction, and to discuss its significance in contemporary Western societies, as well as its implications for the understanding of religion. The author suggests that we should acknowledge, to a greater degree, the extent to which religion can be mixed with commerce, titillating entertainment, shared emotions, and everyday concerns. In addition, the author suggests that we should make more room for partial and shifting religious engagements in religion, and acknowledge a place, in the category of religion, for supernatural popular culture. The current fantasy popularity surge indicates not only a weakening of institutionalised religions, but also of the importance of belief and absolute truth claims in religion, and instead we see an increased visibility of ‘the religious’ and shifting and partial forms of religion in the West.","Fantasy fiction both reflects and forms religious interests and religious fascination in contemporary society, providing sites for exploration of religion.",question,2074,155.0
7736,social media in reducing inequalities in accessing stem education,Integrating Social Media Platforms in Construction Education to Increase Student Engagement,"This study evaluates the integration of Social Media (SM) as an informal pedagogical tool to support STEM, by fostering engagement and increasing interactional competency and collaborative skills. Construction engineering education has been plagued with low engagement levels partially due to its timeworn pedagogical means and ineffective use of technology. SM platforms are convenient, and effective informal educational means that encourage engagement and interactions between peers. Nowadays, construction programs are shifting to online educational forms and this research is geared to understand the interactions between student bodies within different instructional forms. This study focuses on assessing the impact of SM related activities on students’ engagement and professional skills by integration it within Construction Management (CM) courses. The novel contribution of this research is to study the benefit of integrating SM not only for increasing student engagement but also effective communication between online and face to face CM students as well as their soft skill development.

We sought to determine whether effortful and automatic processing were differentially associated with subsequent mood and cortisol levels during a stressful challenge. We examined this question by having clinically anxious, depressed, and control participants perform a modified spatial cueing task with supraliminal and masked pictorial stimuli during a stressful challenge and control condition. The stressful challenge, relative to the control condition, lowered mood, but did not influence cortisol levels.

196,is compression a good treatment for restless leg syndrome?,Successful spinal cord stimulation for severe medication‐refractory restless legs syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs, classically accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms typically worsen during rest and at night. Pharmacotherapy includes levodopa/dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants (alpha-2-delta ligands), opioids, and iron supplementation. Nonpharmacologic approaches involve pneumatic compression, near-infrared spectroscopy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. One patient who underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for neuropathic pain experienced improvement of concomitant RLS. Analogously, spinal transcutaneous direct current stimulation and limb transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may improve RLS. Currently, SCS to specifically treat RLS has not yet been reported. We present an otherwise healthy 24-year-old student suffering nonfamilial RLS. Symptoms started at age 12 and gradually progressed. He reported a crawling leg sensation at rest, alleviated by mobilizing, maximum at night, but eventually present throughout the day. He slept only 4 to 5 hours nightly and had prolonged sleep latency. Besides repetitive voluntary leg movements, neurological examination was normal. Polysomnography performed elsewhere excluded sleep disordered breathing (apnea hypopnea index 2.1 without significant oxygen desaturation) and demonstrated periodic limb movement arousals (indices unavailable). Serum markers measuring iron status (total iron = 20 μmol/L [9-32], ferritin = 170 μg/L [22-275], transferrin saturation = 33% [20-50]) and thyroid and renal function were normal. He was on zolpidem 10 mg, clonazepam 0.25 mg, and medical marijuana with limited benefit. Levodopa/carbidopa, pramipexole, and ropirinole initially improved RLS but subsequently contributed to augmentation. Rotigotine, retigabine, gabapentin, pregabalin, loprazolam, zolpidem, melatonin, venlafaxine, morphine, oxycodone, codeine, nabilone, oral iron supplementation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and compression socks were ineffective. Ferric carboxymaltose was unavailable in Canada. He refused methadone. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation only helped partially and was cumbersome. After a multidisciplinary review, institutional approval, and detailed consenting, a spinal epidural paddle electrode was implanted at T7-9 under general anesthesia (Fig. 1B). Following a 1-week inpatient trial period, confirming good leg coverage and symptom improvement, an internal pulse generator (IPG) was implanted and programmed (Fig. 1C). Subjectively, his legs were instantaneously less restless with SCS on, even in the absence of SCS-induced paresthesia, for example, with stimulation in certain positions or at lower amplitudes. Six months postoperatively, the International RLS Study Group rating scale and RLS 6-item questionnaire scores were reduced by 44% and 25%, respectively. This translated into a 33% improvement in RLS-Quality of Life questionnaire score (Fig. 1A). Subjectively and polysomnographically, sleep quality (no more periodic limb movement arousals) and duration (6-8 hours) improved, with some remaining sleep onset insomnia. Medication was gradually tapered to exclusively zolpidem 5 mg occasionally. This benefit is sustained at 33 months, with gradual worsening upon IPG depletion and instantaneous improvement after IPG replacement (Fig. 1A). SCS was considered on experimental and theoretical grounds. Theoretically, SCS-induced paresthesia may override uncomfortable ascending sensations, similar to one postulated mechanism in neuropathic pain. Indirect action via modulation of sensory cortices and/or cerebellum is also possible. SCS may substantially improve RLS severity and quality of life. Although this is a single case and SCS-induced paresthesia renders blinding difficult, symptom recurrence/improvement upon IPG depletion/replacement, respectively, is encouraging. However, a placebo response, common in RLS, cannot be excluded. Further study is warranted to define the role of SCS in medication-refractory RLS.","Pneumatic compression, a nonpharmacologic approach, is mentioned as a potential treatment for restless legs syndrome.",question,4018,117.0

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the incorporation of a subject's background exposure to the sun and pigmentation characteristics (which are assumed to influence a person's susceptibility to sunlight exposure) could produce stronger associations between sunlight exposure and the risk for melanoma. A population-based case-control study was performed in the mid-eastern part of the Netherlands. The study group comprised 141 patients with a histologically verified melanoma and 183 controls with other malignancies who were registered by the same cancer registry. Patients with a lentigo maligna melanoma or an acrolentiginous melanoma were excluded. Information was collected by interviews and physical examination. We categorized subjects as indoor or outdoor workers on the basis of occupational exposure to the sun. Pigmentation characteristics, which are known to be risk indicators for cutaneous melanoma, were summarized as one sun sensitivity score. We used this score to distinguish between sun-sensitive and sun-resistant persons. The odds ratios associated with sunbathing, vacations spent in sunny countries, and sunburns were higher among the indoor workers than among the outdoor workers. After stratification by the sun sensitivity score, the effect of sunbathing, participating in water sports (swimming excluded), vacations to sunny countries, and a history of sunburn was largest for the sun-sensitive persons. The data show a general trend toward higher relative risks among indoor workers and sun-sensitive individuals.

Results: The results of the current study document high anti-S total IgG antibody titers in cord serum at birth in all mother–infant pairs analyzed. The mean umbilical cord blood sample IgG antibody titer anti-S protein was 1026.51 U/mL (±SD 769.25). The mean cord-to-maternal anti–S IgG antibody ratio was 1.28 (±SD 0.798). A significant positive correlation was observed between the week of gestation at which the first dose was administered and the week of gestation at which the second dose was administered, and the respective cord-to-maternal ratio (r = 0.48; p = 0.0029) for the first dose and (r = 0.39; p = 0.0102) for the second dose. Conclusions: To date, despite the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination, there is a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccination of pregnant women. Therefore, the results we present are complementary. Our study suggests that maternal immunization may provide neonatal protection through the transplacental transfer of antibodies. Of particular importance is the demonstration that antibody transfer is correlated with the time from vaccination to delivery, which may allow future determination of the optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.","Maternal immunization may provide neonatal protection through the transplacental transfer of antibodies, but conclusive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccination in pregnant women is lacking.",question,2095,208.0
14834,does Yoga improve mental health?,Effect of yoga based lifestyle intervention on subjective well-being.,"Yoga is assuming importance in improving mental health and quality of life in the treatment of a number of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders. The present study was a prospective controlled study to explore the short-term impact of a comprehensive but brief lifestyle intervention, based on yoga, on subjective well being levels in normal and diseased subjects. Normal healthy individuals and subjects having hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus or a variety of other illnesses were included in the study. The outcome measures were 'subjective well being inventory' (SUBI) scores, taken on the first and last day of the course. The inventory consists of questions related to one's feelings and attitude about various areas of life, such as happiness, achievement and interpersonal relationship. There was significant improvement in the subjective well being scores of the 77 subjects within a period of 10 days as compared to controls. These observations suggest that a short lifestyle modification and stress management educational program leads to remarkable improvement in the subjective well being scores of the subjects and can therefore make an appreciable contribution to primary prevention as well as management of lifestyle diseases.",A short lifestyle modification and stress management educational program based on yoga leads to remarkable improvement in subjective well-being scores.,question,1267,151.0
23512,effect of transportation in education and academic performance,Closer Proximity to the Subway Network Implies Lower High School Test Scores: Evidence from a Subway Expansion,"This paper identifies and quantifies the effects of better transport accessibility on student performance measured by mathematics test scores. A 24 km new subway line and the extension of an existing line in Santiago (Chile) in the mid-2000s reduced the distance between more than half of schools in the city and their nearest subway station. Estimates are derived using instrumental variables and fixed effects models that account for endogeneity in the relation between student performance and school-subway network distance. Substantial closer proximity to the subway network (5 km or more) is associated with lower test scores (11 percentage points of one standard deviation). I find evidence that some mechanisms could be an increase in the student/teacher ratio, an increase in parental hours of work and a worsening in the quality of peers of students in treated schools relative to students in control schools.",Closer proximity to the subway network (5 km or more) is associated with lower test scores (11 percentage points of one standard deviation).,phrase,918,140.0
7950,does personality determine one’s career choice?,Personality Changes Predict Early Career Outcomes: Discovery and Replication in 12-Year Longitudinal Studies,"In this research, we examined whether personality changes from adolescence to young adulthood predicted five early career outcomes: degree attainment, income, occupational prestige, career satisfaction, and job satisfaction. The study used two representative samples of Icelandic youth (Sample 1: n = 485, Sample 2: n = 1,290) and measured personality traits over 12 years (ages ~17 to 29 years). Results revealed that certain patterns of personality growth predicted career outcomes over and above adolescent trait levels and crystallized ability. Across both samples, the strongest effects were found for growth in emotional stability (income and career satisfaction), conscientiousness (career satisfaction), and extraversion (career satisfaction and job satisfaction). Initial trait levels also predicted career success, highlighting the long-term predictive power of personality. Overall, our findings show that personality has important effects on early career outcomes—both through stable trait levels and how people change over time. We discuss implications for public policy, for theoretical principles of personality development, and for young people making career decisions.","Personality changes in emotional stability, conscientiousness, and extraversion predict early career outcomes such as income, career satisfaction, and job satisfaction.",question,1185,168.0
17817,are covid-19 vaccines dangerous?,Association between BNT162b2 or CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccines and major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals with cardiovascular disease,"Abstract Aims Concern about the cardiovascular safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines among individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) may lead to vaccine hesitancy. We sought to assess the association between two COVID-19 vaccines, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac, and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with established CVD. Methods and results We identified individuals with a history of CVD before 23 February 2021 and a diagnosis of MACE between 23 February 2021 and 31 January 2022 in Hong Kong. MACE was defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and cardiovascular death. Electronic health records from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority were linked to vaccination records from the Department of Health. A self-controlled case-series method was used to evaluate the risk of MACE for 0–13 and 14–27 days after two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to compare the risk of MACE between each risk period and the baseline period. A total of 229 235 individuals with CVD were identified, of which 1764 were vaccinated and had a diagnosis of MACE during the observation period (BNT162b2 = 662; CoronaVac = 1102). For BNT162b2, IRRs were 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23–1.02] for the first dose and 0.87 (95% CI 0.50–1.52) for the second dose during the 0–13 days risk period, 0.40 (95% CI 0.18–0.93) for the first dose and 1.13 (95% CI 0.70–1.84) for the second dose during the 14–27 days risk period. For CoronaVac, the IRRs were 0.43 (95% CI 0.24–0.75) for the first dose and, 0.73 (95% CI 0.46–1.16) for the second dose during the 0–13 days risk period, 0.54 (95% CI 0.33–0.90) for the first dose and 0.83 (95% CI 0.54–1.29) for the second dose during the 14–27 days risk period. Consistent results were found in subgroup analyses for different sexes, age groups and different underlying cardiovascular conditions. Conclusion Our findings showed no evidence of an increased risk of MACE after vaccination with BNT162b2 or CoronaVac in patients with CVD. Future research is required to monitor the risk after the third dose of each vaccine.",No evidence of an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events was found after vaccination with BNT162b2 or CoronaVac in patients with cardiovascular disease.,question,2162,167.0

However, current findings are cross-sectional and rely on absolute intensity. This study aimed to examine whether relative or absolute vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) predicts brain microstructural changes. We analyzed 260 initially cognitively normal and well-functioning participants(age=70.5yrs) who had VPA data via ActiHeart and longitudinal brain microstructure by DTI(follow-up=3.7yrs). Associations of VPA with microstructural changes were examined using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for demographics. Each SD higher relative VPA defined by heart rate reserve (i.e. 21 min/day) was significantly associated with less decline in memory-related microstructural integrity, including mean diffusivity of entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus and fractional anisotropy of uncinate fasciculus and cingulum-hippocampal part, and not executive/motor-related microstructure. Absolute VPA was not associated with microstructural markers. Among well-functioning older adults, participating in VPA defined by heart rate reserve may predict less brain microstructural decline in memory-related areas.",Higher relative vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) is associated with less decline in memory-related microstructural integrity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in older adults.,phrase,1234,192.0
13183,does spanking positively impact childhood development?,Examining the Longitudinal Effect of Spanking on Young Latinx Child Behavior Problems,"Spanking is a divisive discipline practice in the USA and is considered an inappropriate and harmful discipline tactic by some scholars and practitioners. However, increased diversity in the USA has contributed to varying cultural beliefs regarding discipline, which in turn influences child development. While prior literature has examined correlates of spanking, few studies have examined its impact on Latinx children over time. We examined the use of spanking by Mexican-American (n = 185) and Dominican-American mothers (n = 141) across three time points. The main objective was to investigate whether maternal spanking predicted externalizing problems in young Latinx youth overtime. Families were recruited from public urban schools. Data were collected when children were 4-, 5- and 6-years old. A three-wave cross-lagged multi-group path analysis examined the potential reciprocal relationships between maternal spanking and child externalizing behaviors. According to cross-sectional linear regression models, spanking was concurrently associated with behavior problems at all three time points. However, the results of the cross-lagged multi-group path analyses showed that spanking did not predict subsequent behavior problems, nor did behavior problems predict subsequent spanking. The impact of spanking on child behavior may not be long-lasting in all Latinx families. Spanking and youth externalizing problems are concurrently and positively related; however, maternal use of spanking as a means of discipline did not result in negative and long term effects on child externalizing problems. Implications for practice with Latinx families are explored.","Spanking and youth externalizing problems are concurrently related, but spanking did not result in negative and long-term effects on child externalizing problems in Latinx families.",question,1668,181.0
6781,what is the effect of design in education public policies,Educational Policy Strategy Under The Papua Special Autonomy Framework,"Abstract. An appropriate policy design is a crucial factor in improving the efficiency of education service. The design is influenced by the significant implementation of education strategies, to which the dimensions of organizational environment, organizational values, and organizational resources contribute. In the case of Jayapura Regency, the dimension that predominantly affects the education service efficiency is the organizational resources, whilst the organizational environment is the least influential. The small influence from the organizational environment results from a strong tendency to disregard the importance of politics, geography, demography, and the potential of natural resources as a dimension of the external environment. Moreover, the education service orientation and public needs accommodation are determined by the support from organizational values and resources.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of worksite intervention consisting of a gratitude exercise on employees’ well-being, such as positive affect, life satisfaction and subjective happiness among Japanese workers. A randomized controlled trial was conducted among daytime local-government employees. Participants in the gratitude group were asked to write down up to five people to whom the participant was grateful or thankful in the past week, and participants in the control group were asked to write down up to five events that occurred during the past week, for 4 weeks. Gratitude-related feelings, positive affect, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness were measured as well-being indices three times, that is, at baseline, immediately post intervention and one-month after the intervention. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that gratitude-related feelings and positive affect improved in both groups. No significant effects were observed on life satisfaction and subjective happiness. Gratitude intervention may be beneficial to increase gratitude-related feelings and positive affect. However, similar tendencies were observed in the control group who were asked to simply write down five events that occurred during the week.

2176,do tanning beds increase the risk of cancer?,Nationwide Analysis on Intentional Indoor and Outdoor Tanning: Prevalence and Correlates,"Outdoor and indoor tanning are considered as risk factors for the development of skin cancer. The aims of this nationwide representative study were to quantify both behaviors in a sample with a wide age range, to identify those showing both behaviors and to explore and compare determinants of both behaviors. We used data from the fifth wave (2019) of the National Cancer Aid Monitoring (NCAM). We surveyed the representative sample including 4000 individuals, aged 16–65 years, living in Germany. Data were collected through telephone interviews. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used logistic regression analyses to identify determinants. The one-year-prevalence of tanning bed use was 7.5%, while 31.9% tanned (very) often intentionally outdoors in at least one situation (weekdays, holidays, and weekends). A total of 3.2% reported both risk behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that tanning bed use is associated with employment, an increased number of naevi, and lack of risk awareness. Intentional outdoor tanning was associated with male sex, younger age, past tobacco use, and low risk awareness of UV radiation. Our findings suggest that only a minority of subjects showed both risk behaviors. This implies that individuals seem to perform either one behavior or the other. In addition, the associated determinants differed between both behaviors, implying that specific preventive measures tailored to address to each tanning behavior are needed.","Both indoor and outdoor tanning pose a risk for skin cancer; however, preventive measures should be tailored to each type of tanning behavior.",question,1470,142.0

13695,Does decriminalizing drugs increase usage?,"Factor and item-response analysis DSM-IV criteria for abuse of and dependence on cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, sedatives, stimulants and opioids.","AIMS
This paper explored, in a population-based sample of males, the factorial structure of criteria for substance abuse and dependence, and compared qualitatively the performance of these criteria across drug categories using item-response theory (IRT).


DESIGN
Marginal maximum likelihood was used to explore the factor structure of criteria within drug classes, and a two-parameter IRT model was used to determine how the difficulty and discrimination of individual criteria differ across drug classes.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 4234 males born from 1940 to 1974 from the population-based Virginia Twin Registry were approached to participate.


MEASUREMENTS
DSM-IV drug use, abuse and dependence criteria for cannabis, sedatives, stimulants, cocaine and opiates.


FINDINGS
For each drug class, the pattern of endorsement of individual criteria for abuse and dependence, conditioned on initiation and use, could be best explained by a single factor. There were large differences in individual item performance across substances in terms of item difficulty and discrimination. Cocaine users were more likely to have encountered legal, social, physical and psychological consequences.


CONCLUSIONS
The DSM-IV abuse and dependence criteria, within each drug class, are not distinct but best described in terms of a single underlying continuum of risk. Because individual criteria performed very differently across substances in IRT analyses, the assumption that these items are measuring equivalent levels of severity or liability with the same discrimination across different substances is unsustainable. Compared to other drugs, cocaine usage is associated with more detrimental effects and negative consequences, whereas the effects of cannabis and hallucinogens appear to be less harmful. Implications for other drug classes are discussed.","Compared to other drugs, cocaine usage is associated with more detrimental effects and negative consequences, whereas the effects of cannabis and hallucinogens appear to be less harmful.",question,1846,186.0

18766,can caffiene improve athletic performance?,Sleep Hygiene for Optimizing Recovery in Athletes: Review and Recommendations,"Abstract For elite athletes who exercise at a high level, sleep is critical to overall health. Many studies have documented the effects of sleep deprivation in the general population, but few studies exist regarding specific effects in the athlete. This review summarizes the effects of sleep deprivation and sleep extension on athletic performance, including reaction time, accuracy, strength and endurance, and cognitive function. There are clear negative effects of sleep deprivation on performance, including reaction time, accuracy, vigor, submaximal strength, and endurance. Cognitive functions such as judgment and decision-making also suffer. Sleep extension can positively affect reaction times, mood, sprint times, tennis serve accuracy, swim turns, kick stroke efficiency, and increased free throw and 3-point accuracy. Banking sleep (sleep extension prior to night of intentional sleep deprivation before sporting event) is a new concept that may also improve performance. For sports medicine providers, the negative effects of sleep deprivation cannot be overstated to athletes. To battle sleep deprivation, athletes may seek supplements with potentially serious side effects; improving sleep quality however is simple and effective, benefiting not only athlete health but also athletic performance.","Sleep extension can positively affect reaction times, mood, sprint times, tennis serve accuracy, swim turns, kick stroke efficiency, and increased free throw and 3-point accuracy.",question,1312,179.0

Prior factor analytic studies have tested these constructs in cross-sectional studies, and models have been replicated longitudinally, but no study has tested a constrained longitudinal model. The authors examined 4 PDs in the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders study (schizotypal, borderline, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive) over 7 time points (baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 4 years, 6 years, and 10 years). Data for 2-, 4-, 6- and 10-year assessments were obtained in semistructured interviews by raters blind to prior PD diagnoses at each assessment. The latent structure of the 4 constructs was differentiated during the initial time points but became less differentiated over time as the mean levels of the constructs dropped and stability increased. Obsessive-compulsive PD became more correlated with schizotypal and borderline PD than with avoidant PD.

Analysis of the decisions to incarcerate made by black and white trial judges in a large northeastern community reveal that black judges are more evenhanded in their treatment of black and white defendants than are white judges, who tend to treat white defendants somewhat more leniently. In overall sentence severity, where little racial discrimination has been found, white judges treat black and white defendants equally severely, while black judges treat black defendants somewhat more leniently than white defendants. While the impact of black judges is, therefore, somewhat mixed, in the crucial decision to incarcerate, having more black judges increases equality of treatment.","Increasing descriptive representation among judges leads to more evenhanded treatment of black and white defendants, particularly in the decision to incarcerate.",question,1012,161.0

After the event, these children were monitored by local pediatricians and serum samples were collected at the first visit and 30 days after vaccination and tested for SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology with Ortho total IgG anti-S1 protein and Cpass, an ACE2 receptor binding domain inhibition assay. Only one child had a mild symptom after vaccination, with no other adverse events documented up to the 30 days follow-up. Of 27 children tested 3-9 days after vaccination, 5 (19%) had positive serology suggesting a previous natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, with all 19 tested on day 30 after vaccination and presenting with positive tests, with an increment of antibody titers in those initially positive. A low Cpass binding inhibition was observed in the first collection in 11 seronegative cases, with high titers among those anti-S1 positive. All children showed an important increase in antibody titers on day 30. The event allowed the documentation of a robust serological response to one dose of CoronaVac in this small population of young children, with no major adverse effects. Although it was an unfortunate accident, this event may contribute with future vaccine strategies in this age group.

Non-traumatic meniscal rupture is a common musculoskeletal disease, but it is unknown if it is caused by inability of the menisci to remodel. The aim of this study was to determine whether meniscal collagen is remodelling throughout life. Methods The life-long turnover of the human meniscal collagens was explored by the 14C bomb pulse method. 14C levels were determined in menisci from 18 patients with osteoarthritis and 7 patients with healthy knees. Results There was a negligible turnover of the meniscal collagen in adults. This low turnover was observed in menisci from patients with knee osteoarthritis and in healthy menisci. Conclusion This study provides evidence that essentially no remodelling occurs in the adult human meniscal collagen structure and explains the clinical degeneration that is often seen in menisci of middle-aged and elderly persons. It suggests that strengthening of the collagen structure of menisci, as response to physical activity, may occur during childhood, while it is not possible in the adult population.","Meniscal collagen does not remodel in adults, which may explain degeneration in middle-aged and elderly persons.",question,1211,112.0

16925,what mirna upregulate anti-oxidant genes,MicroRNA-145-5p Protects Human Melanocytes Against Oxidative Damage by Targeting Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 (TRPM2),"Background: Oxidative stress was reported to be involved in the progression of vitiligo. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to display critical roles in vitiligo. In this study, we conjectured that miR-145-5p might be related to the development of vitiligo by regulating the
 key genes expression in melanocytes. Methods: H2O2 was used to induce the dysfunction of melanocytes. The levels of TRPM2 and miR-145-5p in H2O2-induced human primary melanocytes were assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase
 chain reaction (RT-qPCR). TargetScan and Dual luciferase reporter gene assay were conducted to confirm the correlation between miR-145-5p and TRPM2. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using MTT and Flow cytometry analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzymes superoxide
 dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined using specific assay kits. The levels of cleaved caspase-3 and pro-Caspase3 were measure by western blotting. Results: TRPM2 was upregulated while miR-145-5p was downregulated in H2O2-induced human primary melanocytes.
 Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that TRPM2 was a target gene of miR-145-5p. miR-145-5p mimic transfection significantly increased cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in H2O2-treated melanocytes. In addition, overexpression of miR-145-5p enhanced the antioxidant
 activity of SOD and CAT, and decreased intracellular ROS accumulation. Notably, these findings were abolished by TRPM2-plasmid. Conclusions: Taken together, our study demonstrated that oxidative stress induced up-regulation of TRPM2 and down-regulation of miR-145-5p in melanocytes.
 In addition, overexpression of miR-145-5p alleviated melanocytes destruction via targeting TRPM2. These results indicated that miR-145-5p might serve as a potential target for anti-oxidative therapy in vitiligo.","miR-145-5p protects melanocytes against oxidative damage by targeting TRPM2, enhancing antioxidant activity of SOD and CAT, and decreasing intracellular ROS accumulation.",question,1868,170.0

6187,does the sun influence in the morphology in leaves?,SHOOT MORPHOLOGY AND LEAF ANATOMY IN RELATION TO PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses shoot morphology and leaf anatomy in relation to photosynthesis. The youngest leaves of a non-shaded plant usually grow in full sunlight. Some weeks later, the same leaves, now totally expanded and mature, may be shaded to a certain extent by the newly developed younger leaves. This would mean that the light intensity available for photosynthesis could be reduced to less than 10% of full sunlight and, therefore, cause very low net leaf photosynthesis. Therefore, plants may show a distinct leaf arrangement along the stem, which guarantees optimal use of the irradiated light and makes full sunlight available for the largest amount of leaf area. In a growing canopy, these differences in available light are even more striking. The other microclimatic factors show comparable gradients because of the height, density, and geometry of the canopy. Some plants have leaves that adapt well to these changes in the microclimate, whereas others lack this ability.","Plants show a distinct leaf arrangement along the stem, optimizing the use of irradiated light and making full sunlight available for the largest amount of leaf area.",question,1003,166.0
22792,does family history impact childhood development?,A review of instruments for assessing family history.,"The influence of family history on one's development has long been a focus of psychological theory, research, and practice. In recent years, however, conceptualizations of family influences on development have evolved considerably, and there has also been increased concern about the reliability of individuals' memory for their childhoods in general. Current knowledge regarding these and other issues are applied to reviewing the instruments that have been developed to assess aspects of family history. The complexity of this type of assessment is emphasized, and a variety of problems with the reliability and validity of the currently available instruments are discussed. Suggestions for future research are also offered.",The abstract emphasizes the complexity of assessing family history's impact on childhood development and discusses problems with the reliability and validity of current instruments.,question,726,181.0
12887,what are the side effects of probiotics?,Safety of Probiotics,"Abstract Probiotics are considered “generally recognized as safe,” and are widely used in the prevention and treatment of several diseases. However, four types of side effects may be connected with probiotics: systemic infections, risk of deleterious metabolic activities, risk of adjuvant side effects and immunomodulation, and risk of gene transfer. The most common adverse effects of probiotics include gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Other side effects include respiratory infections, abscesses, allergic reactions, and severe medical conditions, such as sepsis, fungemia, and endocarditis. In recent years, many species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Enterococcus, and Bifidobacterium were isolated from various types of infective lesions. Common use of probiotics may increase the risk of side effects. An assessment of the risk connected with intake of edible probiotic products, based on the literary data of documented cases of infections caused by probiotics as well as epidemiological data, has been discussed in the chapter.","Probiotics may cause side effects like gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory infections, abscesses, allergic reactions, and severe medical conditions such as sepsis, fungemia, and endocarditis.",question,1125,195.0
172,how does institutional violence influence elderly care work?,The Relationship Between Burnout and the Risk of Violence Against Institutionalised Elderly People: The Case of Formal Care,"The work overload of the formal caregiver of the elderly is frequent and can cause health problems, both psychological and physical. One is Burnout, a phenomenon which is already considered a public health problem, which mainly affects caregivers (both formal and informal) [1]. This study aimed to analyse how the Burnout of caregivers of the elderly may be related to the risk of violence against institutionalised elderly people. 82 formal caregivers participated, from institutions that receive elderly people, temporarily or permanently, and that collaborated with the project Aging in Safety in the Alentejo - Understanding to Act, of the University of Evora. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and the Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE) were applied, and a quantitative approach was applied using IBM-SPSS software (version 24). The results indicate that caregivers have low levels of Burnout and that there is a low risk of violence against the elderly. However, significant correlations were found between these two dimensions. There is a need for intervention in this professional group, focusing on the promotion of workers’ health in the prevention of, and combat against, Burnout Syndrome, with the adoption of coping strategies. This could reduce the effects of prolonged stress levels experienced by formal caregivers of the elderly, in order to then reduce the possibility of acts of violence against the elderly.",Higher burnout levels in caregivers are correlated with a higher risk of violence against institutionalized elderly people.,question,1428,123.0
11568,ideal volume for strength training,Effects of training volume on lower-body muscle strength in untrained young men: a contralateral control study,"Aims: 
 
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of training volume (1 vs. 3 sets) on lower-body muscle strength in untrained young men. 
 
Methodsː 
 
Eighteen untrained young men were recruited and their legs were trained with 1 or 3 sets (in a contralateral design) for 6 weeks, using a knee extension machine. Isokinetic peak torque and one repetition maximum (1RM) were assessed at pre- and post-training. 
 
Resultsː 
 
There was a similar improvement in the 1RM strength (1SET: +14.8% vs. 3SET: 16.3%, P > 0.05) and peak torque (1SET: +8.1% vs. 3SET: 9.3%, P > 0.05) for both conditions from pre- to post-training. The effect size (ES) for the change in 1RM was moderate for both conditions (1SET: 1.39 vs. 3SET: 1.41), and peak torque was trivial and small for 1SET (0.47) and 3SET (0.55), respectively. Additionally, there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in the dietary intakes from pre- to post-training. 
 
Conclusionsː 
 
Our results indicate that 1 set is as effective as 3 sets for increasing lower-body muscle strength after a short-term RT period (6 weeks) in untrained young men.",One set is as effective as three sets for increasing lower-body muscle strength after a 6-week training period in untrained young men.,phrase,1120,134.0
18945,the effects of a traumatic brain injury on the human body,"Factors Predicting Functional and Cognitive Recovery Following Severe Traumatic, Anoxic, and Cerebrovascular Brain Damage","Objectives:To compare demographic data, clinical data, and rate of functional and cognitive recovery in patients with severe traumatic, cerebrovascular, or anoxic acquired brain injury (ABI) and to identify factors predicting discharge home. Participants:Three hundred twenty-nine patients with severe ABI (192 with traumatic, 104 with cerebrovascular, and 33 with anoxic brain injury). Design:Longitudinal prospective study of inpatients attending the intensive Rehabilitation Department of the “Sacro Cuore” Don Calabria Hospital (Negrar, Verona, Italy). Main measures:Etiology, sex, age, rehabilitation admission interval, rehabilitation length of stay, discharge destination, Glasgow Coma Scale, Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Glasgow Outcome Scale, Levels of Cognitive Functioning, and Functional Independence Measure. Results:Predominant etiology was traumatic; male gender was prevalent in all the etiologic groups; patients with traumatic brain injury were younger than the patients in the other groups and had shorter rehabilitation admission interval, greater functional and cognitive outcomes on all considered scales, and a higher frequency of returning home. Patients with anoxic brain injury achieved the lowest grade of functional and cognitive recovery. Age, etiology, and admission DRS score predicted return home. Conclusions:Patients with traumatic brain injury achieved greater functional and cognitive improvements than patients with cerebrovascular and anoxic ABI. Age, etiology, and admission DRS score can assist in predicting discharge destination.",Patients with traumatic brain injury achieved greater functional and cognitive improvements than patients with cerebrovascular and anoxic ABI.,phrase,1573,142.0
6768,is proactive control related to psychopathology?,Distinct characteristics of psychopathy relate to different subtypes of aggression,"This article both selectively reviews the evidence supporting the view that reactive and proactive aggression actually reflect related but separate constructs, and also investigates the selective relationship between these forms of aggression and psychopathic personality in 121 male prison inmates. Results show that total psychopathy scores were related to residualized scores of proactive (but not reactive) aggression. However, different sub-characteristics of psychopathy were differentially related to reactive as well as proactive aggression. Results support the view that reactive and proactive aggression have differential correlates, and suggest that while psychopathic personality is predominantly characterized by proactive aggression, some psychopathy components are more related to reactive aggression.","Psychopathic personality is predominantly characterized by proactive aggression, but some components are more related to reactive aggression.",question,816,141.0
12395,do home crowds impact referee bias?,The 12th man?: refereeing bias in English and German soccer,"Summary.  The paper investigates potential bias in awards of player disciplinary sanctions, in the form of cautions (yellow cards) and dismissals (red cards) by referees in the English Premier League and the German Bundesliga. Previous studies of behaviour of soccer referees have not adequately incorporated within‐game information. Descriptive statistics from our samples clearly show that home teams receive fewer yellow and red cards than away teams. These differences may be wrongly interpreted as evidence of bias where the modeller has failed to include within‐game events such as goals scored and recent cards issued. What appears as referee favouritism may actually be excessive and illegal aggressive behaviour by players in teams that are behind in score. We deal with these issues by using a minute‐by‐minute bivariate probit analysis of yellow and red cards issued in games over six seasons in the two leagues. The significance of a variable to denote the difference in score at the time of sanction suggests that foul play that is induced by a losing position is an important influence on the award of yellow and red cards. Controlling for various pre‐game and within‐game variables, we find evidence that is indicative of home team favouritism induced by crowd pressure: in Germany home teams with running tracks in their stadia attract more yellow and red cards than teams playing in stadia with less distance between the crowd and the pitch. Separating the competing teams in matches by favourite and underdog status, as perceived by the betting market, yields further evidence, this time for both leagues, that the source of home teams receiving fewer cards is not just that they are disproportionately often the favoured team and disproportionately ahead in score. Thus there is evidence that is consistent with pure referee bias in relative treatments of home and away teams.","Home team favoritism induced by crowd pressure is evident, as teams playing in stadia with less distance between the crowd and the pitch receive fewer yellow and red cards.",question,1895,172.0
12350,does perceived stigma lead to negative urgency in chronic pain?,Stigma perception and depression among patients suffering from chronic somatoform disorders,"Introduction Several studies indicate a significant longitudinal comorbidity of depression and chronic pain. Also, perceived stigma is a barrier to recovery. This study wanted to evaluate the correlations. Objectives To investigate to what degree chronic pain patients suffer from depression and stigma fears 132 (66% females) consecutive in- and out-patients with somatoform pain disorders who presented at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (MUV) were investigated using the Stigma Questionnaire by Link and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Aims The aim of this study was to survey the attitudes of 132 patients with the diagnosis somatoform pain disorder, toward mental illness stigma and the influence of depressive symptoms. Methods The BDI was employed for measuring of the severity of depression and the modified 12-item version of Links Stigma Questionnaire to evaluate stigma perception. Results Three third of the patients expect discrimination because of their psychiatric diagnosis and two third of the chronic pain patients also showed depressive symptoms. The overall results show a significant correlation between stigma perception and depressive symptoms. Conclusion Fear of stigma increases with depressive symptoms and both are a risk for treatment delay. Goal of future research should be the question how to reduce depression and fear of stigma in order to help them enter psychiatric treatment early and gain self-confidence and mental health back again.","Fear of stigma increases with depressive symptoms in chronic pain patients, and both are a risk for treatment delay.",question,1491,116.0
1285,what is the relationship between r&d and firm productivity?,"Ownership, Government R&D, Private R&D, and Productivity in Chinese Industry","Abstract This paper examines the relationship between research and development (R&D) expenditure and productivity in China's enterprises. An empirical model that contains a system of three equations, i.e., the production function, a private R&D equation, and a government R&D equation, is estimated using a cross-sectional data set for Chinese enterprises of various ownership types. We find a strong link between private R&D and firm productivity. Although its direct contribution to firm productivity is insignificant, government R&D contributes indirectly to productivity by promoting private R&D. Hence, providing incentives for enterprises to invest in R&D may be a better alternative than providing R&D grants directly. J. Comp. Econ. , March 2001 29 (1), pp. 136–157.

7343,can birth control pills lead to anxiety?,Psychological affects of oral contraceptives.,2 small-scale studies on the relationship between oral contraceptives (OCs) and psychological states (e.g. depression) are presented. The first study was a preliminary investigation of factors that might affect a womans response to OCs. Interview and a psychometric battery formed of the Rotter Locus of control scale and the Leeds scale for self-assessment of depression and anxiety were the investigative tools. Subjects were women attending a fertility control clinic for the first time. The second study was designed to investigate in greater detail the relationship between the use of OCs and concomitant mood changes. This study concentrated on women using OCs being matched with controls using other contraceptive measures. This test was performed repeatedly over a single menstrual cycle. The first study found that Ocs of low estrogen content did not produce many side effects of either physical or psychological etiology. Women who did have psychological depression as an effect of OC use tended to have previously experienced premenstrual tension symptoms. None of these subjects however developed clinical signs of depression or anxiety. In the second study the clusters around Nowlis factors (surgency elation fatigue sadness and social affection) showed the greates variability among control subjects and very little variability among OC users. Overall these studies showed little evidence suggesting that OCs are likely to produce clinical depression in women who are seeking reliable birth control. When feelings of lowered mood did occur they could not be directly related to the physiological effects of OCs however.,"Oral contraceptives of low estrogen content did not produce many side effects, and there was little evidence suggesting they lead to clinical anxiety or depression.",question,1634,164.0
