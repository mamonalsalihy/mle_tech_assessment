1086,what is the relationship between self-efficacy and resistance training performance in athletes,Self-efficacy does not appear to mediate training’s effect on performance based on the moderation-of-process design,"ABSTRACT Researchers in the area of training and motivation have concluded that training causes improvements in performance partially via training’s influence on self-efficacy. A set of studies employing a moderation-of-process design contradicts this conclusion. Specifically, when two groups of trainees did not know their performance was increasing during training, their self-efficacy did not increase. Two other groups were able to observe improving performance, which enhanced self-efficacy. However, both groups in both studies exhibited equal improvement in performance. This effect was shown in two contexts: training on a physical task and training on a cognitive task. These results demonstrate that self-efficacy might not always play a causal role in determining training’s influence. The studies highlight the value of a rarely used moderation-of-process method for assessing mediation.",Self-efficacy may not always play a causal role in determining training’s influence.,question,900,113.0

17538,is stroke correlated to covid-19?,Features of etiopathogenetic factors and course of stroke after coronavirus infection,"Disorder of coronary circulation is one of the most severe complications of COVID‑19. Strokes that develop against the background of coronavirus infection are more often associated with occlusion of large vessels and have a more severe course. The frequency of strokes associated with COVID‑19, according to different authors, ranges from 1 to 6 %.Objective. To analyze the etiopathogenetic factors, the course of stroke after a coronavirus infection, and to analyze the possible relationship between the severity of COVID‑19 and the severity of stroke.Materials and methods. Observation of 110 patients of the neurological department of the First Republican Clinical Hospital of Udmurtia for the period from 2020 to 2021 with confirmed ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke associated with COVID‑19. Statistical data processing was carried out in Microsoft Excel 2013, MedCalc.Results. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiac arrhythmia predominated in the structure of comorbidities in the examined patients. In 88.0 % of cases, ischemic stroke was observed in patients after infection, mainly the lesion concerned the carotid basin (55.5 %). Patients more often had focal neurological symptoms, among which hemiparesis and hemiplegia prevailed. Features of the results of laboratory diagnostics is the presence of coagulopathy, renal and hepatic insufficiency: increased levels of fibrinogen, D-dimers, creatinine, urea, proteinuria. According to neuroimaging data, in 54.5 % of cases, the stroke focus was more than 15 mm; duplex scanning of vessels in 95.0 % of cases revealed signs of atherosclerosis of the brachiocephalic arteries, carotid arteries in 54.5 % of cases. Correlation analysis revealed the relationship between the severity of COVID‑19 and the clinical manifestations of stroke. Most of the strokes occurred in the subjects within 1–6 months (40.9 %) after suffering COVID‑19.Conclusion. In the development of stroke after suffering COVID‑19, coagulopathy, renal liver failure, cardiovascular comorbidities, especially hypertension, and atherosclerosis play a significant role.

3342,does high protein diet protect against bone loss as we age?,Protein and bone health across the lifespan,"Bone health is determined by the rate of accrual in early life, followed by the rate of age-associated bone loss. Dietary protein intake might have a role in bone health across both of these phases via pleiotropic mechanistic pathways. Herein we summarise the pathways through which protein may exert either a positive or negative influence on bone. In the introduction, we describe the acid-ash hypothesis, which states that a high-protein intake may lead to an acidic residue that must be neutralised through the leaching of calcium and other minerals from the bone, subsequently leading to demineralisation and bone weakening. Conversely, and as described in the ‘Against: mechanisms through which protein may negatively impact bone’ section, protein intake may act to strengthen the bone by stimulating the activity of various anabolic hormones and growth factors, or by optimising muscle mass and functionality, which itself has an osteogenic influence. The net effect of these contrasting pathways is described in the ‘For: mechanisms through which protein may positively impact bone’ section, where a number of meta-analyses have demonstrated that higher protein intakes have a small positive impact on bone mass and fracture risk. Sometimes higher than recommended protein intakes are advised, e.g. during the earlier and later phases of the lifespan or during reduced energy availability. We conclude that protein is an essential nutrient for bone health, although further research is required to clarify the mechanistic pathways through which it exerts its influence, along with the clarification of the quantities, food sources and timing to allow for the optimisation of this protective influence and ultimately a reduction in fracture risk.","High protein intake may lead to an acidic residue that must be neutralised through the leaching of calcium and other minerals from the bone, leading to demineralisation and bone weakening.",question,1753,83.0
15715,Do interest rates impact inflation?,Stock market performance: Reaction to interest rates and inflation rates,"This paper investigates the wealth effects of the consumer price index, interest rate, domestic credit and real economic activity on the Amman Stock Exchange performance. Over the period 1991–2020 using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test. While the interest rate is a powerful monetary tool to fight inflation and recession, it can be detrimental to investors. The target variables, consumer price index (CPI) and interest rate (IDR), are both highly significant with the correct signs. An increase of 1 percent in CPI and IDR leads to a fall in stock prices by 1.6 percent and 5 percent, respectively. While the central bank is targeting inflation by raising interest rates, its actions reflect negatively on the stock market. The short-run model confirms the causality from the independent variables to the dependent variable. Moreover, the error correction term (ECT) is very high and significant at the 1 percent level amounting to 83.3 percent, which confirms the evidence of the long-run relationship. Monetary objectives are really important, but financial stability is also important.","Interest rates are a powerful monetary tool to fight inflation and recession, but can be detrimental to investors.",question,1111,131.0

4525,what does the research say about risk for patients receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy?,Effect of High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy in Immunocompromised Subjects With Acute Respiratory Failure,"BACKGROUND: Various studies have been performed to examine the effect of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). However, the results were inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of HFNC oxygen therapy in immunocompromised patients with ARF versus conventional oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV). METHODS: Relevant studies published prior to May 11, 2019, were systematically searched. The primary outcome was intubation rate; secondary outcomes were mortality (ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 90-d mortality) and ICU-acquired infections. Data were pooled using the random effects model. RESULTS: Of 832 identified studies, 8 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis (N = 2,167 subjects). HFNC was associated with lower intubation rates compared to conventional oxygen therapy (risk ratio [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.00, P = .040), but we found no significant difference in the rate between HFNC and NIV (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46–1.19, P = .22). We also found that HFNC did not increase the risk of ICU-acquired infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63–1.18, P = .35). However, in comparison to other noninvasive therapies, HFNC exhibited no differences in ICU mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58–1.17, P = .28), in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74–1.15, P = .48), or 90-d mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81–1.18, P = .82). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HFNC may be a feasible alternative to NIV, with lower intubation rates and no increased risk for ICU-acquired infections compared to standard oxygen therapy. However, HFNC did not appear to reduce mortality in immunocompromised subjects with ARF compared with other noninvasive therapies. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials should be performed to confirm these findings.","High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy may be a feasible alternative to conventional oxygen therapy, with lower intubation rates and no increased risk for ICU-acquired infections.",question,1851,121.0
9107,does spanking positively impact childhood development?,Spanking and young children’s socioemotional development in low- and middle-income countries,"Spanking is one of the most common forms of child discipline used by parents around the world. Research on children in high-income countries has shown that parental spanking is associated with adverse child outcomes, yet less is known about how spanking is related to child well-being in low- and middle-income countries. This study uses data from 215,885 children in 62 countries from the fourth and fifth rounds of UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) to examine the relationship between spanking and child well-being. In this large international sample which includes data from nearly one-third of the world’s countries, 43% of children were spanked, or resided in a household where another child was spanked, in the past month. Results from multilevel models show that reports of spanking of children in the household were associated with lower scores on a 3-item socioemotional development index among 3- and 4-year-old children. Country-level results from the multilevel model showed 59 countries (95%) had a negative relationship between spanking and socioemotional development and 3 countries (5%) had a null relationship. Spanking was not associated with higher socioemotional development for children in any country. While the cross-sectional association between spanking and socio-emotional development is small, findings suggest that spanking may be harmful for children on a more global scale than was previously known.","Spanking may be harmful for children on a more global scale than previously known, but it may be harmful for children on a more global scale.",question,1446,148.0
14939,Can red wine improve cardiovascular functioning?,"Red wine, arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics.","Red wine is considered to reduce cardiovascular risk and decrease peripheral systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Central aortic pressures are often more sensitive clinical and prognostic factors than peripheral pressures, while arterial stiffness is an independent prognostic factor for cardiovascular events. Great efforts are being made to find natural sources of improving health. In order to clarify the mechanisms under which a widely used drink, like red wine, is affecting heart and vessels, we aimed to review the available data regarding the effects of red wine on arterial stiffness, wave reflections and central blood pressures. The effect of red wine on central hemodynamics has been poorly explored with divergent results. Possible consequences of acute and long-term intake on arterial stiffness, wave reflections and central pressures are not clear.

549,how does social inequality affect the mental health of people in india,Social Vulnerability and Mental Health Inequalities in the “Syndemic”: Call for Action,"Covid-19 is referred to as a “syndemic,” i.e., the consequences of the disease are exacerbated by social and economic disparity. Poor housing, unstable work conditions, caste, class, race and gender based inequities and low incomes have a profound effect on mental health and wellbeing. Such disparities are increasing between, among and within countries and are exacerbated by human rights violations, in institution and in society, stigma and discrimination. Social capital can mediate health outcomes, through trust and reciprocity, political participation, and by mental health service systems, which can be coercive or more open to demand of emancipation and freedom. Societal inequalities affect especially vulnerable groups, and Covid itself had a wider impact on the most socially vulnerable and marginalized populations, suffering for structural discrimination and violence. There are complex relations among these social processes and domains, and mental health inequalities and disparity. Participation and engagement of citizens and community organizations is now required in order to achieve a radical transformation in mental health. A Local and Global Action Plan has been launched recently, by a coalition of organizations representing people with lived experience of mental health care; who use services; family members, mental health professionals, policy makers and researchers, such as the International Mental Health Collaborating Network, the World Federation for Mental Health, the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the Global Alliance of Mental Illness Advocacy Networks (GAMIAN), The Mental Health Resource Hub in Chennai, India, The Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) and others. The Action Plan addresses the need for fundamental change by focusing on social determinants and achieving equity in mental health care. Equally the need for the politics of wellbeing has to be embedded in a system that places mental health within development and social justice paradigm, enhancing core human capabilities and contrasting discriminatory practices. These targets are for people and organizations to adopt locally within their communities and services, and also to indicate possible innovative solutions to Politics. This global endeavor may represent an alternative to the global mental discourse inspired by the traditional biomedical model.","Societal inequalities and disparities are increasing between, among and within countries and are exacerbated by human rights violations, in institution and society, stigma and discrimination.",question,2387,191.0

20335,advantages and disadvantages to taking vitamin d,"Vitamin D: sources, physiological role, biokinetics, deficiency, therapeutic use, toxicity, and overview of analytical methods for detection of vitamin D and its metabolites","Abstract Vitamin D has a well-known role in the calcium homeostasis associated with the maintenance of healthy bones. It increases the efficiency of the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, reduces calcium losses in urine, and mobilizes calcium stored in the skeleton. However, vitamin D receptors are present ubiquitously in the human body and indeed, vitamin D has a plethora of non-calcemic functions. In contrast to most vitamins, sufficient vitamin D can be synthesized in human skin. However, its production can be markedly decreased due to factors such as clothing, sunscreens, intentional avoidance of the direct sunlight, or the high latitude of the residence. Indeed, more than one billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient, and the deficiency is frequently undiagnosed. The chronic deficiency is not only associated with rickets/osteomalacia/osteoporosis but it is also linked to a higher risk of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or cancer. Supplementation of vitamin D may be hence beneficial, but the intake of vitamin D should be under the supervision of health professionals because overdosing leads to intoxication with severe health consequences.

15246,is human nature violent?,On Being Human(e),"A frequent and ironic sentiment we encounter is that violence cannot be prevented because “after all, it’s human nature to be violent.” While yes, on face value one can accept that we are “just” animals. Taking a philosophical and scientific approach to this, one can ask “what makes us unique?” We are, after all, just one of approximately 5000 living members of the mammal class of animal. Mammals are subject to their evolutionarily-honed genetic drives for survival, as are all living organisms. These drives can be perceived as violent and callous and are manifest through the use of available physical tools (e.g. tooth and claw) to survive and reproduce in a challenging environment. Unique to humans, however, is the extent to which we can use the brain as our survival tool, affording the opportunity to adapt our environment to suit us rather than our adaptation to suit our environment. We use this brain tool to introspect, to understand our individual role in a larger community of thinkers, in order to mutually benefit and perpetuate our species. We can in essence, override our base instincts and drives, making conscious decisions to “do the right thing.” Therefore the irony is that, to be human is to be humane.","To be human is to be humane, but violence cannot be prevented because it's human nature to be violent.",question,1230,143.0

11373,what is idh2 mutation?,Quantitative detection of IDH2 mutation for minimal residual disease monitoring in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and its comparison with mutations in NPM1 gene,"Acquired mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes have been detected in various hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where the incidence has been reported to be 15% [1 – 6]. Th e IDH1 and IDH2 genes encode enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α -ketoglutarate ( α -KG). Somatic mutations cause their dysfunction and an accumulation of aberrant 2-hydroxygluterate (2-HG) product in cells [5]. Th e decreased supply of α -KG or increased accumulation of 2-HG (i.e. metabolic biomarker of mutant IDH1/2 enzyme activity) is considered to be a possible basis for the oncogenic properties of IDH mutants [7]. Mutations in the IDH2 gene exclusively aff ect hotspot regions c.G419 (p.R140) and/or c.G515 (p.R172), which both localize in exon 4. Th e most frequent mutation in patients with AML reported to date is heterozygous c.G419A (p.R140Q) [8,9]. The use of IDH2 mutations for the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is under investigation and still remains unclear [8,10,11]. Recently, using conventional sequencing, we have reported that IDH2 mutations are stable and associated with the course of AML [11]. However, the sensitivity of direct sequencing limits its use for MRD monitoring. Thus, we developed a novel realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assay that enables rapid and sensitive quantification of the IDH2 c.G419A (p.R140Q) mutation. Here, we report on the applicability of the newly developed method for MRD monitoring in patients with AML and then compare the results with those obtained from monitoring NPM1 mutations. We investigated 60 unique samples [43 bone marrow (BM) and 17 peripheral blood (PB), Figure 1(A)] at different time points of AML treatment of eight patients with AML harboring the IDH2 mutation c.G419A (p.R140Q) who were previously or currently being treated in our institution from 2008 to 2012. With the exception of a single patient (patient no. 7) who received palliative treatment using low-dose cytosine arabinoside, all patients received curative therapy, including standard induction (45 mg/m 2 daunorubicin for 3 days and 100 – 200 mg/m 2 cytosine arabinoside for 7 days) or a double induction with the same drug combination. Additional treatment consisted of two to three consolidation chemotherapies (mostly highdose 3 g/m 2 cytosine arabinoside BID on days 1, 3 and 5, or 100 – 200 mg/m 2 cytosine arabinoside for 5 days and 9 mg/m 2 mitoxantrone for 2 days). Four patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Within this cohort, 6/8 patients harbored a parallel NPM1 mutation (fi ve patients had mutation A and one had mutation B). Th e patient characteristics are summarized in Figure 1(A). All patients signed an informed consent before the samples were collected, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. PB (patient nos. 1, 4 and 7) and BM (patient nos. 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8) samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a total volume of 5 mL each. Samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, monthly during induction and consolidation, every 2 – 3 months during follow-up, and at the time of hematological relapse. Th e number of samples per patient ranged between three and 14 and the median follow-up was 13.0 months (range 4 – 25 months).

13854,impact of mobile phone use on family relationships,Mobility and Emotional Harmonization in Families,"Abstract Families and social relationships are of course highly important, so it is worthwhile to ask how they are being affected by omnipresent mobile communication. In this paper, I will examine how increasingly portable communication technology affects daily activities and social relationships, especially in terms of the relationship between children and parents. While much of my focus will be on practices in other parts of the world, many of these trends may be applicable to China. Prior studies have created a body of generally accepted views about this area, and often concluded that mobile phone use was leading to increased separation between young people and their parents. However, a body of recent research on current practices among older teens does not offer support of this view. Rather, in many cases, mobile phones seem to impede independence-seeking behavior of young people. Thus the proliferation of mobile phones may actually be delaying the psychological maturation of young people even while strengthening and prolonging the process of (two-way) parent-child socialization. The seeming paradox in these results is discussed in my talk, and a synthesis is advanced that seeks to explain the new situation of locational dispersion and familial acculturation under conditions of mobility. Specifically, the current practices go beyond the concept of “hypercoordination” (proposed by Ling in 1999) and can be described as “emotional harmonization.”","Mobile phone use leads to increased separation between young people and their parents, impedeing independence-seeking behavior of young people.",phrase,1471,165.0

If innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, creativity is the specific mission of the arts; both are strategic resources in the knowledge economy. This complementarity is evident in regions where the creative classes are boosting economic development through the use of technology and innovation. The current research on entrepreneurship in the cultural and creative industry finds that these new firms have a number of particular characteristics: idiosyncratic sources of opportunity, a higher level of innovation, and a greater use of recent technologies. The research uses data from the GEM Spain 2005 project, which identified 1,299 entre- preneurial initiatives associated with cultural and creative resources","Creative classes complement a society's technical and scientific knowledge and help uncover new opportunities, develop changes and innovation, and intensify the use of new technolo-gies.",question,1062,150.0

18607,is tap water safe?,Pharmaceuticals in Tap Water: Human Health Risk Assessment and Proposed Monitoring Framework in China,"Background: Pharmaceuticals are known to contaminate tap water worldwide, but the relevant human health risks have not been assessed in China. Objectives: We monitored 32 pharmaceuticals in Chinese tap water and evaluated the life-long human health risks of exposure in order to provide information for future prioritization and risk management. Methods: We analyzed samples (n = 113) from 13 cities and compared detected concentrations with existing or newly-derived safety levels for assessing risk quotients (RQs) at different life stages, excluding the prenatal stage. Results: We detected 17 pharmaceuticals in 89% of samples, with most detectable concentrations (92%) at < 50 ng/L. Caffeine (median–maximum, nanograms per liter: 24.4–564), metronidazole (1.8–19.3), salicylic acid (16.6–41.2), clofibric acid (1.2–3.3), carbamazepine (1.3–6.7), and dimetridazole (6.9–14.7) were found in ≥ 20% of samples. Cities within the Yangtze River region and Guangzhou were regarded as contamination hot spots because of elevated levels and frequent positive detections. Of the 17 pharmaceuticals detected, 13 showed very low risk levels, but 4 (i.e., dimetridazole, thiamphenicol, sulfamethazine, and clarithromycin) were found to have at least one life-stage RQ ≥ 0.01, especially for the infant and child life stages, and should be considered of high priority for management. We propose an indicator-based monitoring framework for providing information for source identification, water treatment effectiveness, and water safety management in China. Conclusion: Chinese tap water is an additional route of human exposure to pharmaceuticals, particularly for dimetridazole, although the risk to human health is low based on current toxicity data. Pharmaceutical detection and application of the proposed monitoring framework can be used for water source protection and risk management in China and elsewhere.","Chinese tap water is an additional route of human exposure to pharmaceuticals, particularly for dimetridazole, but the risk to human health is low based on current toxicity data.",question,1905,130.0
1843,is scoliosis surgery effective,Long-term Results of Conservative Therapy of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Using the Cheneau Brace,"Abstract Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a disease of the growing skeleton. The goal in therapy is to decelerate or to prevent progression of the spinal curve. As part of a retrospective study the patient group of the scoliosis surgery from 1995–2016 was analysed according to the inclusion criteria of the Scoliosis research Society (SRS). 159 of 643 of the patients fullfilled the specific criteria. The assessment of effectiveness was based on the progression of the angle of curvature. If it was ≤5° it was judged positively. The therapy in accordance to Cheneau is a full-time bracing orthosis. Data from 159 patients – 136 fem. (85.5%), 23 male (14.5%) was analysed. The average age at the beginning of treatment was 13.3±1.7 years. The average duration was 3.47±1.2 years. The average Cobb-angle before treatment was 28.39°±9.44°. At the completion is was 27.7°±12.34°. Stabilisation of scoliosis (≤5°) was achieved for 136 of the patients (85.5%). The final follow-up showed a progression of the Cobb angel>5° in 23 cases, of which 19 had to undergo secondary surgery. The length of therapy had a positive influence (p=0.057) on the result. Brace treatment constitutes an effective method of therapy at curvatures between 20–40°. Short duration of therapy correlates with a expressively increased risk towards progression (p=0.057). The Cheneau brace treatment constitutes an effective treatment at curvature angles between 20–40°. The risk of progression can be reduced by a timely and correct identification.",Cheneau brace treatment constitutes an effective method of therapy at curvatures between 20–40°.,question,1521,138.0
22871,is category theory important in biology,Hierarchies and the Sloshing Bucket: Toward the Unification of Evolutionary Biology,"Evolutionary biology presents a bewildering array of phenomena to scientists and students alike—ranging from molecules to species and ecosystems; and embracing 3.8 billion years of life’s history on earth. Biological systems are arranged hierarchically, with smaller units forming the components of larger systems. The evolutionary hierarchy, based on replication of genetic information and reproduction, is a complex of genes/organisms/demes/species and higher taxa. The ecological hierarchy, based on patterns of matter–energy transfer, is a complex of proteins/organisms/avatars/local ecosystems/regional ecosystems. All organisms are simultaneously parts of both hierarchical systems. Darwin’s original formulation of natural selection maps smoothly onto a diagram where the two hierarchical systems are placed side-by-side. The “sloshing bucket” theory of evolution emerges from empirical cases in biological history mapped onto this dual hierarchy scheme: little phenotypically discernible evolution occurs with minor ecological disturbance; conversely, greatest concentrations of change in evolutionary history follow mass extinctions, themselves based on physical perturbations of global extent. Most evolution occurs in intermediate-level regional “turnovers,” when species extinction leads to rapid evolution of new species.

The aim of the present study was to investigate short‐ and long‐term consequences of neurotoxic METH doses on mice behaviors. Male BALB/c mice, 12–14 weeks old, were injected with dl‐METH (i.p., 7.5 mg/kg x 4 times, every 2 hours) or saline. Behaviors were accessed at 10 days after drug treatment. METH administration caused significant decreases in responding to object displacement using an Open Field Object Recognition test. In contrast, METH caused increased response to object novelty. There were no drug‐induced effects on locomotor activity. Moreover, repeated METH injections resulted in significant decreases in dopamine (DA) levels in the STR, frontal cortex (FC) and olfactory bulb (OB) in mice sacrificed 10 days after drug treatment. Furthermore, as previously reported for the cortex and striatum, METH administration caused marked increases in the number of cells that were positive for TUNEL staining in the OB at 3 days, observations that are indicative of drug‐induced enhancement of cell death in that structure. When taken together, these results suggest that METH caused impairments in spatial learning and/or memory as a consequence of its neurodegenerative effects.",METH administration causes impairments in spatial learning and/or memory as a consequence of its neurodegenerative effects.,question,1376,114.0

Pollinators are therefore important for India’s food security. India also contains 9 of the world’s 10 most polluted cities, but the impact of air pollution on plant and animal systems is largely unknown. We performed a multiyear study in the megacity of Bangalore to correlate the mechanistic effects of air pollution on a major Indian pollinator, the Giant Asian honey bee, Apis dorsata. Wild honey bees and lab-reared Drosophila exposed to air pollution exhibited differences in survival, behavior, heart rate, blood cell count, and/or the expression of genes related to stress, immunity, and metabolism. Our study indicates the urgency for more studies on wild systems to better inform international air quality guidelines. While the impact of air pollution on human health is well studied, mechanistic impacts of air pollution on wild systems, including those providing essential ecosystem services, are largely unknown, but directly impact our health and well-being. India is the world’s largest fruit producer, second most populous country, and contains 9 of the world’s 10 most polluted cities. Here, we sampled Giant Asian honey bees, Apis dorsata, at locations with varying air pollution levels in Bangalore, India. We observed significant correlations between increased respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) deposition and changes in bee survival, flower visitation, heart rate, hemocyte levels, and expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, stress, and immunity. Lab-reared Drosophila melanogaster exposed to these same sites also exhibited similar molecular and physiological differences. Our study offers a quantitative analysis on the current impacts of air pollution on insects, and indicates the urgency for more nonhuman studies to accurately assess the effects of pollution on our natural world.","Air pollution directly impacts our health and well-being, particularly on plant and animal systems.",question,1921,204.0

Objective To explore differences in the Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 (FMQ-10; Azevedo et at. 2015), between sleep groups, in Portuguese pregnant women. Methods Four hundred and nineteen pregnant women (mean age: 32.51 ± 4.759; weeks of gestation: 17.32 ± 4.803) answered the Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 and the Insomnia Assessment Scale (IAS, Marques et al., 2015). Three sleep groups were created considering all the IAS items: good sleepers (no insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment); insomnia symptoms groups (one/more insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment; exclusion of other conditions/disorders explaining the symptoms); insomniacs (one/more insomnia symptoms; one/more daily associated impairment; exclusion of other conditions/disorders explaining the symptoms). Results There were significant differences in the total FMQ-10 score, the F1/Nonjudging of inner experience and the F2/acting with awareness, between sleep groups [respectively, F (2.402) = 6,933; P = 0.001; F (2.406) = 10.243; P = 0.001; F (2.406) = 37.431; P = 0.002]. Tukey tests indicated that the mean total FMQ-10 and F1/Nonjudging of inner experience scores of good sleepers and insomnia symptoms group were significantly higher than of the insomniacs.

16399,is drinking milk good for the heart,[The nutrients of the milk on cardiovascular health].,"The incidence of milk components on cardiovascular health is reviewed. A fraction of great interest in relation to cardiovascular disease is that of minerals, especially calcium. Benefits of milk in reducing blood pressure due to bioavailable calcium, along with other mineral elements present and bioactive peptides with antihypertensive ability, ACE inhibitors (key enzyme involved in the regulation of blood pressure) have been documented. Furthermore, a positive association of diets with high levels of calcium from milk, the fecal excretion of fat--which is favored by the same--and cardiovascular markers has also been reported. The presence in the milk of the essential, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic fatty acids, although at low levels, is particularly interesting. Moreover, in the milk fat bioactive components as conjugated linoleic acid and sphingomyelin, which could exert potential cardioprotective effects are also present. However, because it contains high levels of saturated fatty acids, milk fat products consumption has been discouraged indiscriminately. According to the evidence collected in a long series of scientific studies it can be concluded that consumption of milk/dairy balanced and low-fat could be neutral effect or be inversely associated with cardiovascular risk.",Drinking milk/dairy balanced and low-fat could be neutral effect or inversely associated with cardiovascular risk.,question,1305,169.0

204,does metacognition improves learning?,Digital Teaching Materials and Their Relationship with the Metacognitive Skills of Students in Primary Education,"Metacognition is a construct that is noteworthy for its relationship with the prediction and enhancement of student performance. It is of interest in education, as well as in the field of cognitive psychology, because it contributes to competencies, such as learning to learn and the understanding of information. This study conducted research at a state school in the Community of Madrid (Spain) with a sample of 130 students in Grade 3 of their primary education (8 years old). The research involved the use of a digital teaching platform called Smile and Learn, as the feedback included in the digital activities may have an effect on students’ metacognition. We analyzed the implementation of the intelligent platform at school and the activities most commonly engaged in. The Junior Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (Jr. MAI) was the measuring instrument chosen for the external evaluation of metacognition. The study’s results show a higher use of logic and spatial activities. A relationship is observed between the use of digital exercises that have specific feedback and work on logic and visuospatial skills with metacognitive knowledge.

14378,current hot questions in behavioural biology,Using an integrative approach to investigate the evolution of behaviour,"Behaviour is a central focus of interest in biology because it has an impact on several aspects of an organism's life. Evolutionary biologists have realised the advantage of an integrative approach that jointly studies the molecular, cellular and physiological levels of an individual to link them with the organismal behavioural phenotype. First, this mechanistic information helps in understanding physiological and evolutionary constraints acting on the behavioural response to the environment and its evolution. Second, it furthers our understanding of the process of molecular convergent evolution. Finally, we learn about natural variation in molecular, cellular and physiological traits present in wild populations and their underlying genetic basis, which can be a substrate for selection to act on. I illustrate these points using our work on behaviour variation in fishes. The information on the mechanistic bases of behaviour variation in various species and behaviours will contribute to an ecological annotation of genes and to uncover new mechanisms implicated in how this astonishing behavioural diversity arose, is maintained and will evolve.","Integrating the molecular, cellular and physiological levels of an individual helps understand physiological and evolutionary constraints acting on the behavioural response to the environment and its evolution.",phrase,1158,177.0

5977,effect of emotional neglection to child?,New insights on affective morbidity and childhood maltreatment,"Childhood maltreatment (physical, sexual or emotional abuse, and physical or emotional neglect, by a parent, caregiver or other adult) is a major problem of global significance. Children who suffered maltreatment of any kind are known to experience a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, eating disorders, suicidal symptomatology and personality disorder. These problems often emerge in childhood and last through adulthood to old age. Furthermore, people with a history of childhood maltreatment show a worse-than-usual response to standard treatment approaches to improve their mental health. There is growing evidence that emotional abuse, one of the most prevalent forms of childhood maltreatment, may have the most wide-ranging impact of all maltreatment types on mental health outcomes as it appears to be a transdiagnostic risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, and found to me more strongly associated with development of affective disorders than physical abuse or neglect. There is a need to move beyond simple association studies and shift the research focus on sophisticated multimodal studies to fully understand the psychobiological mechanisms underlying affective morbidity, as well as the protective factors that might promote resilience, in the face of (specific forms of) childhood maltreatment.

6236,does public complaint on construction site?,Convolutional neural network: Deep learning-based classification of building quality problems,"Abstract The rapid development of the construction industry in China has introduced unprecedented quality-related problems in the country’s building industry. In response to this issue, the government has established various complaint channels to report quality problems. Therefore, building quality complaints (BQCs) need to be classified and solved by respective agencies or departments rapidly for avoiding adverse impact on the safety, health, and well-being of people. However, the current process of classifying BQCs is labor intensive, time consuming, and error prone. An automatic complaint classification is required to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of complaint handling, but studies on this issue are limited. Prevailing text classification research in construction has focused on utilizing conventional shallow machine learning. By contrast, this study explores a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that incorporates a deep-learning method to automatically classify the short texts contained within BQCs. The presented approach enables capturing the semantic features in BQC texts and automatic classification of the BQCs into predefined categories. After the model optimization, tests are conducted to examine the practical application of the text classification approach compared with Bayes-based and support vector machine classifiers. Results indicate that the developed CNN-based approach performs well in the Chinese BQC classification with limited manual intervention and few complicated feature engineering.","An automatic complaint classification is required to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of complaint handling, but studies on this issue are limited.",question,1559,198.0

Experience in each has shown that one of the most effective methods for improving services has been the establishment of systems of accreditation. Accreditation has been defined as the ""recognition accorded to an institution that meets the standards or criteria established by a competent agency or association. Its general purpose is to promote and inspire high quality of services.':* Accreditation is primarily a means for assuring competence in performance for a hospital, a high school, a university, a social agency, etc. It is an assurance to the public that the accredited agency or institution is well organized, well administered, well staffed and well equipped, and it affords a protection to the public against substandard services. A lengthy account could be written of accreditation as a method of social control. However, it is a well-known fact that groups, institutional representatives, and professional persons with mutual interests find it helpful to discuss common problems. Out of this mutuality of interest and the necessity of detemilning who should become members of these groups certain criteria or standards are developed. As this process evolves it may become structured and formalized into a system of accreditation.

Most current few shot methods use a base dataset rich in labeled examples to train an encoder that is used for obtaining representations of support instances for novel classes. Since the test instances are from a distribution different to the base distribution, their feature representations are of poor quality, degrading performance. In this paper we propose to make use of the well-trained feature representations of the base dataset that are closest to each support instance to improve its representation during meta-test time. To this end, we propose BaseTransformers, that attends to the most relevant regions of the base dataset feature space and improves support instance representations.

13984,how to balancing class in fraud detection ecommerce using machine learning?,Automatic Machine Learning Algorithms for Fraud Detection in Digital Payment Systems,"Data on global financial statistics demonstrate that total losses from fraudulent transactions around the world are constantly growing. The issue of payment fraud will be exacerbated by the digitalization of economic relations, in particular the introduction by banks of the concept of ""Bank-as-a-Service"", which will increase the burden on payment services. The aim of this study is to synthesize effective models for detecting fraud in digital payment systems using automated machine learning and Big Data analysis algorithms. Approaches to expanding the information base to detect fraudulent transactions have been proposed and systematized. The choice of performance metrics for building and comparing models has been substantiated. The use of automatic machine learning algorithms has been proposed to resolve the issue, which makes it possible in a short time to go through a large number of variants of models, their ensembles, and input data sets. As a result, our experiments allowed us to obtain the quality of classification based on the AUC metric at the level of 0.977‒0.982. This exceeds the effectiveness of the classifiers developed by traditional methods, even as the time spent on the synthesis of the models is much less and measured in hours. The models' ensemble has made it possible to detect up to 85.7 % of fraudulent transactions in the sample. The accuracy of fraud detection is also high (79‒85 %). The results of our study confirm the effectiveness of using automatic machine learning algorithms to synthesize fraud detection models in digital payment systems. In this case, efficiency is manifested not only by the resulting classifiers' quality but also by the reduction in the cost of their development, as well as by the high potential of interpretability.

13509,why does dipterocarp seedlings showed negative relative growth rate?,Patterns of dynamic irradiance affect the photosynthetic capacity and growth of dipterocarp tree seedlings,"In the deeply shaded understorey of S.E. Asian rain forests the growth and survival of dipterocarp seedlings is limited by their ability to maintain a positive carbon balance. Photosynthesis during sunflecks is an important component of carbon gain in understorey plants. To test the sensitivity of photosynthesis and growth to variation in the pattern of dynamic irradiance, dipterocarp tree seedlings (Shorea leprosula and Hopea nervosa) were grown for 370 days under shaded forest light treatments of equal total daily photosynthetic photon flux density (~3.3 mol m-2 day-1), but characterised by either long flecks (LF) or short flecks (SF). Seedling growth was more than 4-fold greater under LF, compared with SF, in both species. Variation in the relative growth rates (RGR) and light saturated rates of photosynthesis (Amax) were strongly positively correlated with the mean duration of sunflecks. Variation in RGR was strongly correlated with greater unit leaf rate growth, indicating that photosynthetic carbon gain per unit leaf area was greater under LF. The accumulation of starch in leaves over the diurnal period was 117% greater in both species under LF, compared with SF. Greater carbon gain in seedlings under LF is likely to have resulted from the combination of (1) greater Amax (S. leprosula 35%, H. nervosa 40%), (2) more efficient dynamic photosynthesis, and (3) greater incident photosynthetic quantum yield, compared with seedlings receiving the SF irradiance treatment. The pattern of dynamic irradiance received by seedlings may significantly impact their growth and survival to a previously unrecognised extent, with important consequences for regeneration processes and hence forest structure and composition.","Dipterocarp tree seedlings are limited by their ability to maintain a positive carbon balance, with photosynthesis during sunflecks contributing to their growth and survival.",question,1737,168.0

The present study examines the moderating roles of RWA and SDO in the contact-prejudice relationship, targeting dissident, dangerous, and derogated outgroups: lesbians and gay men, people with schizophrenia, and Indigenous Australians, respectively. In total, 234 participants self-reported contact and prejudice against these outgroups and completed RWA and SDO scales. Contact predicted less prejudice against lesbians and gay men and Indigenous Australians in participants high in RWA and participants high in SDO. However, contact only predicted less prejudice against people with schizophrenia in participants low in RWA or SDO. The results suggest that the ability for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice in prejudice-prone individuals may depend on the outgroup targeted, specifically the threat they pose and the level of prejudice held against them.",Intergroup contact reduces prejudice against a variety of social outgroups and is particularly effective at reducing prejudice in individuals most prone to it.,question,1126,218.0

20026,how covid news affect public attitude?,Understanding Public Attitudes Toward COVID-19 with Twitter,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a part of our everyday life in the year of 2020. Many people have turned to online social media platforms to share what they think and how they feel about the sudden impact the pandemic has brought upon us. This project aims to study public attitudes toward COVID-19 on Twitter, a popular social network platform. In particular, it focuses on discovering what issues around COVID-19 people are discussing, why they are interested in such topics, and how their emotions have evolved over time. The study further seeks to reveal potential associations between the breakout and any hidden idea previously unknown to the general public. The dataset was created by collecting approximately 150,000 tweets with keywords or hashtags related to COVID-19 over a course of four weeks with Python and Twitter API. A comprehensive analysis of the tweets was performed using natural language processing methodologies including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word embedding. The results suggest that many people may be failing to practice appropriate safety measures to stop the spread, despite their high interests in the COVID-19 crisis. In other words, their proactive online actions are not influencing their offline, real-life behaviors.","Many people may be failing to practice appropriate safety measures to stop the spread, despite their high interests in the COVID-19 crisis.",question,1284,145.0

21236,what are the barriers to dentists adopting hypnosis into their practice,Hypnosis called effective for dentally handicapped.,"Hypnosis was recommended Tuesday as an effective psychological method to increase the comfort of the ""dentally handicapped"" patient. Dr. Kenneth A. Bartlett, Jr. of Montclair, N. J., said hypnosis has helped in treating extremely nervous and apprehensive patients who ""can truly be classified as dentally handicapped."" In almost all of these cases the traumatic cause was not physical but psychological. Addressing the ADA scientific session, he pointed out that there are two kinds of hypnosis which can be applied in dentistry. One is an informal spontaneous type which is really controlled relaxation and a good interpersonal relationship between dentist and patient. The other kind is formal hypnosis which should only be practiced by dentists who have had formal training in this field, he cautioned. ""If we are aware of the psychological importance of dental care, if we are treating people and not teeth, some form of trance is likely to occur in 90 per cent of our patients. I call this need hypnosis. It is a controlled chairside manner and it is something more. ""A more interpersonal relationship with our patients is, in itself, hypnotic. Let us consider the definition of good interpersonal relationship to be the attitude of trust, confidence, friendship and respect developed in the patient by the doctor. Since it is interpersonal, it calls also for a respect for the needs and feelings of the patient and an appreciation of him as a person,"" he stated. ""Hypnosis is an art, clouded with mysticism and confused with gross misinformation,"" he explained. ""The popular concept of hypnosis in which the operator completely dominates the subject, has almost no place in professional practice. As we begin to apply hypnosis we soon learn that we are dealing not with black magic but with the psychology of the dental situation and the dental patient."" In discussing formal hypnotic utilization technics in the dental practice, Dr. Bartlett said ""all of the technics we use to motivate people at an everyday conscious level such as authority, permissiveness, persuasion, reason, seduction, startle, confusion and blackmail are also the basis of hypnotic induction technics."" He added: ""By the same token all of the approaches we use in formal hypnosis to utilize the trance state, such as relaxation dissociation, altered physiological function and distraction are available to us in the routine treatment of our patients. ""In formal hypnosis the suggestions may be somewhat different, but the results are very much the same. In formal hypnosis we attempt to produce relaxation because it is far more difficult to be hurt if one is relaxed,"" he said.

Why do we have leaders instead of an algorithm making decisions? The theory of the firm recognizes benefits to centralizing authority but these organizational benefits from hierarchy have not been clearly separated from the specific contributions of leaders. We define leadership as the ability to successfully manage agency and coordination costs created by the purpose of a given organization. The balance between these two types of costs depends on the purpose of the organization and determines the traits relevant for effective leadership. We develop hypotheses about the role of leadership across organizations. We test our hypotheses with data on Soccer Managers in Brazil, NFL coaches, and Deans of Business and Law Schools. Consistent with our hypotheses we find that leadership and changing leaders matters more in sports teams than for Deans.","Leadership is the ability to successfully manage agency and coordination costs created by the purpose of a given organization, determining the traits relevant for effective leadership.",question,908,115.0

5073,is there anti-black racism in ontario's education system?,Subverting Whiteness and Amplifying Anti-Racisms: Mid-Level District Leadership for Racial Justice,"This counternarrative study positions two distinct bodies of literature in conversation: mid-level district leadership in the literature on educational change and anti-racist approaches to leadership framed through Critical Race Theory and Critical Whiteness Studies. Interviews with twelve, mid-level district leaders committed to anti-racism in Ontario, Canada, reveal fundamental differences in leaders’ knowledges and capacities compared to those identified in the literature on educational change and promoted in the corresponding leadership frameworks in Ontario. In centering power, racialization, and whiteness as a logic of oppression, anti-racist approaches to leadership fundamentally reconstitute conceptions and enactments of leadership. Findings speak to the importance of knowledge(s) about race and racialization, racism and intersecting oppressions, and how whiteness subverts anti-racist efforts. Findings also speak to developing capacities such as: visioning that both owns historical injustices and imagines future possibilities; organizing and collectivizing as a means of power sharing and decentering the individual leader; facilitating difficult learning in the face of racist resistance and multiple frameworks; securing accountability for rights by building informal accountability structures while advocating for formal ones; aligning resources and creating structures in support of students from historically oppressed communities; and, sustaining the self in the face of the impending harm in doing this work. With a focus on whiteness, this study invites scholars and practitioners to turn the gaze upward and consider what might need to be undone and unlearned from multiple and intersecting systems of oppression, what the authors refer to as unleading.","Whiteness subverts anti-racist efforts, focusing on race and racialization, racism and intersecting oppressions, and facilitating difficult learning in the face of racist resistance and multiple frameworks.",question,1786,211.0
531,timing of protein for muscle growth,"Synthesis and degradation of mixed proteins, and composition changes in skeletal muscle of malnourished and refed rats.","Selected compositional parameters of hind leg skeletal muscle and the rates of synthesis and degradation of mixed proteins were measured in rats (154 g initial weight) after ad libitum feeding a low protein diet for 17 weeks, and after 2 to 9 days and 59 to 66 days of refeeding with an adequate diet. The half-life for degradation of the mixed muscle proteins was determined from the change in total hind leg radioactivity between 2 and 7 days following an intravenous injection of 4-MC-aspartic acid. From these data and the size of the hind leg muscle protein pool, the rate of muscle protein synthesis was calcu lated. The prolonged protein-depletion phase resulted in loss of body weight, in crease in the water, chloride and DNA concentrations and a decrease in lipid and RNA in muscle. Refeeding rapidly reversed these changes. The half-life for catabolism of mixed proteins in muscle of depleted rats was 10.2 days as com pared (P > 0.1) with a value of 13.1 days for well-nourished weight-control rats (74 g). During the first 9 days of refeeding, the synthesis of mixed muscle pro teins proceeded at a greater rate (P < 0.01) than in the weight control rats. In contrast, the catabolism of muscle protein was abolished during this period. After 2 months of refeeding, the half-life for catabolism of mixed muscle proteins was 12.6 days. It is concluded that increased synthesis and decreased catabolism of protein play major roles in bringing about a rapid accumulation of muscle pro tein during early protein refeeding. J.

Familiarity with the features of remote monitoring systems and the data supporting its use are vital for physicians’ care for patients with CEIDs. Recent findings Remote monitoring remains underutilized, but its use is expanding including in new practice settings including emergency departments. Patient experience and outcomes are positive, with earlier detection of clinical events such as atrial fibrillation, reductions in inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks and potentially a decrease in mortality with frequent remote monitoring utilizaiton. Rates of hospitalization are reduced among remote monitoring users, and the replacement of outpatient follow-up visits with remote monitoring transmissions has been shown to be well tolerated. In addition, health resource utilization is lower and remote monitoring has been associated with considerable cost savings. A dose relationship exists between use of remote monitoring and patient outcomes, and those with early and high transmission rates have superior outcomes. Summary Remote monitoring provides clinicians with the ability to provide comprehensive follow-up care for patients with CIEDs.

Amidst the crisis, reports of in vitro inhibitory activity of ivermectin, an approved anthelmintic, against the causative SARSCoV2 virus, have generated lot of optimism. In this article, we have fished and compiled the needed information on the drug, that will help readers and prospective investigators in having a quick overview. Though the primordial biological action of the drug is allosteric modulation of helminthic ion channel receptor, its in vitro activity against both RNA and DNA viruses is known for almost a decade. In the past two years, efficacy study in animal models of pseudorabies and zika virus was found to be favourable and unfavourable respectively. Only one clinical study evaluated the drug in dengue virus infection without any clinical efficacy. However, the proposed mechanism of drug action, by inhibiting the importin family of nucleus-cytoplasmic transporters along with favourable pharmacokinetics, warrants exploration of its role in COVID 19 through safely conducted clinical trials. Being an available and affordable drug, enlisted in WHO List of Essential Medicine, and a long track record of clinical safety, the drug is already in clinical trials the world over. As the pandemic continues to ravage human civilisation with unabated intensity, the world eagerly waits for a ray of hope emanating from the outcome of the ongoing trials with ivermectin as well as other drugs.","Ivermectin is an approved anthelmintic, known for its in vitro activity against the causative SARSCoV2 virus, and is already in clinical trials the world over.",question,1539,163.0

6263,how does fluoride affect dental health?,Recent advances in cellular effects of fluoride: an update on its signalling pathway and targeted therapeutic approaches,"Fluoride is a natural element essential in minute quantities in human's to maintain dental and skeletal health. However, the disease fluorosis manifests itself due to excessive fluoride intake mostly through drinking water and sometimes through food. At the cellular energetics level, fluoride is a known inhibitor of glycolysis. At the tissue level, the effect of fluoride has been more pronounced in the musculoskeletal systems due to its ability to retain fluoride. Fluoride alters dentinogenesis, thereby affecting the tooth enamel formation. In bones, fluoride alters the osteogenesis by replacing calcium, thus resulting in bone deformities. In skeletal muscles, high concentration and long term exposure to fluoride causes loss of muscle proteins leading to atrophy. Although fluorosis is quite a familiar problem, the exact molecular pathway is not yet clear. Extensive research on the effects of fluoride on various organs and its toxicity was reported. Indeed, it is clear that high and chronic exposure to fluoride causes cellular apoptosis. Accordingly, in this review, we have highlighted fluoride-mediated apoptosis via two vital pathways, mitochondrial-mediated and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways.

The goal of the NMSP (2014-2020) is ‘to reduce malaria burden to pre-elimination levels and bring malaria-related mortality to zero’ using strategies under seven strategic objectives. The theme for the 2017 World Malaria Day activities was ‘End Malaria for Good’. This theme indicates a sustained push for national and international commitments toward goal zero. Although the prevalence of malaria has dropped significantly, from 42% in 2010 to 27.4% in 2015, a lot of effort needs to be made to actualise a malaria-free Nigeria. This review discusses the current strategies in place to control and eliminate malaria. It also describes some future novelties available to sub-Saharan Africa and Nigeria to ‘End Malaria for Good.’","Malaria prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa remains the highest in the world, with 56% of malaria cases in the West African sub-region.",question,1199,97.0
14946,breathing exercise in acute pain?,Breathing techniques- A review,"Physiotherapy should be offered to patients with a variety of medical respiratory conditions with the aim of breathlessness management and symptom control, mobility and function improvement or maintenance, and airway clearance and cough enhancement or support. Breathing exercises is used as strategy in Lung expansion therapy, Bronchial hygiene therapy and PT techniques to reduce work of breathing. Breathing exercises can be classified as inspiratory and expiratory as some exercise stresses more of inspiration while some stresses expiration. Breathing exercises are used in Restrictive as well as obstructive conditions. In restrictive types of disorders Deep Breathing, Diaphragmatic Breathing, Deep Diaphragmatic Breathing, End – Inspiratory hold, Sustained Maximal Inspiration, Slow Maximal Inspiration, Incentive Spirometer, Sniff, Segmental (Apical and Lateral Costal Activity) are commonly used. Abdominal Breathing, Air Shift Breathing, Glossopharyngeal Breathing are commonly effective in spinal cord injuries. Stacked Breathing, Air Shift Breathing are used in localized and generalised atelectasis of upper lobe respectively. Chest mobility exercises and Belt exercises are used to prevent the formation of disabling adhesions between two layers of pleura.

3830,how can l-carnitine affect energy metabolism,"L-carnitine supplementation improves fatigue, mood and sleep in cancer patients with fatigue and carnitine deficiency.","8588 Background: Carnitine is a natural aminoacid derivative that plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. To determine the dose and tolerability we conducted a phase II study with increasing doses of L-carnitine supplementation. In a preliminary analysis, we reported that L-carnitine could improve fatigue, mood and sleep. (Cruciani et al., 2004). Analysis of the full dataset has confirmed and extended these findings.


METHODS
Patients had active cancer, fatigue and a Karnofsky ≥50. Carnitine deficiency was defined as free carnitine <35 μm]/L for males and <25 for females (normal range 35-67 and 25-55 respectively), or a ratio of acyl/free carnitine >0.4. We utilized a standard maximum tolerated dose (MTD) design, with 3 patients assigned to each successive dose group, starting at 250 mg/day and increasing in each group by 500 mg/day to a maximum dose target of 3000 mg/day. Fatigue (measured by the BFI), depressed mood (CES-D), quality of sleep (ESS), and performance status (Karnofsky), as well as carnitine serum levels were assessed at baseline and after one week of L-carnitine supplementation.


RESULTS
Seven groups of three patients each received L-carnitine supplementation for a week with 250, 750, 1,250, 1,750, 2,250, 2,750 or 3,000 mg/day. Of the 27 patients accrued 21 completed the study. Of these, 17 (mean (SD) age = 63.0 (18), females=8) showed an increase in serum L-carnitine levels. The median (min, max) total carnitine increased from 31 (21, 68) to 51 (29, 111) (p < 0.001) and the free carnitine increased from 25.0 (17, 48) to 39 (25, 82) (p < 0.001). The median (min, max) BFI score at baseline was 63 (36, 81) versus 39 (8, 82) after one week (p<0.001). There was also a significant dose response for BFI (r = -0.61, p = 0.01). Median (min, max) CES-D at baseline was 31. (4, 48) and 18.0 (0, 40) after one-week (p = 0.001). Median (min, max) ESS at baseline was 13.7 (2, 22) and 10.3 (1, 18) after one week (p=0.003). Median Karnofsky score did not change (pre and post = 70). Side effects were not observed in any of the groups.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests that L-carnitine is safe up to 3,000 mg/day. Supplementation was associated with improvements in fatigue and depression scores. Fatigue improved in a dose dependent manner.

Adiponectin has emerged as a promising insulin-sensitizing adipokine; however, the mechanisms by which adiponectin administration improves insulin sensitivity are unclear. Here, we show that globular adiponectin (gAcrp30) and full-length adiponectin (Acrp30) reverse insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice through reductions in ectopic lipid in liver and muscle likely by stimulation of LPL activity in eWAT and increased eNOS/AMPK activation and fat oxidation in muscle.

Several synthetic drugs such as metformin are treatment options of PCOS but the side effects associated with the use of metformin have continued to limit their acceptability; Thus, necessitate the investigation of the safety of Ocimum gratissimum leaves in vivo. The toxicity of ethanolic extract of Ocimum gratissimum leaf (EEOGL) at 50 and 100mg/kg body weight dosage on PCOS was investigated in female Wistar rats. Twenty female Wistar rats with an average weight of 170.81±5.25g were allocated into 5 groups (A-E) of four animals each: group A animals (control) received distilled water while the letrozole-induced (1mg/kg body weight (B.Wt)) rats- groups B, C, D, and We were administered distilled water, co-administration of 7.14mg/kg B.Wt of metformin and 2mg/kg B.Wt of clomiphene citrate, 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg of EEOGL for 21 days respectively.

18880,Can you reverse aging?,Stem cells to reverse aging,"Abstract As human life expectancy continues to increase and the birth rate continues to decline, the phenomenon of aging is becoming more prominent worldwide. Therefore, addressing the problems associated with global aging has become a current research focus. The main manifestations of human aging are structural degeneration and functional decline of aging tissues and organs, quality of life decline, decreased ability to resist diseases, and high incidence rates of a variety of senile degenerative diseases. Thus far, no ideal treatments have been found. Stem cell (SC) therapies have broad application prospects in the field of regenerative medicine due to the inherent biological characteristics of SCs, such as their plasticity, self-renewal, and multidirectional differentiation potential. Thus, SCs could delay or even reverse aging.

20999,what is additives in polypropylene (pp) plastic food packaging?,The Effect of Manganese Palmitate as Pro-Oxidant Additive on Mechanical Properties of Polypropylene,"Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most widely used polymer materials, such as in textile, automotive spare part, furniture, household appliances, and packaging. However, PP is very difficult to degrade naturally. When the product from PP is not reused and discharged into the environment, this plastic can cause problems to the environment. One of the solution to improve degradability of PP is by adding pro-oxidant additives. The addition of pro-oxidant additives can make polypropylene to easily oxidize and degrade into shorter chains by producing carbonyl groups. The pro-oxidant additive used in this research is manganese palmitate. The additive was synthesized by reacting palmitic acid with sodium hydroxide and followed by reaction with manganese chloride tetrahydrate. The purpose of this research was to study the effect of manganese palmitate as a pro-oxidant additive to the structure and mechanical properties of PP before and after thermal treatment. The thermal treatment was carried out by providing heating in PP at various temperatures (25, 60, and 90°C) for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days. The structure and mechanical properties of PP was characterized by functional group analysis (FTIR) and mechanical properties (Tensile tester). FTIR spectra of PP film after thermal treatment at temperature 60 and 90°C showed the presence of carbonyl group in 1700-1720 cm−1 region. After thermal treatment at 90°C, PP film could not be analyzed by mechanical properties because it was damaged and destroyed. The peak intensity of the carbonyl group increased with the increasing temperature of heating. PP films with the addition of manganese palmitate both before and after thermal treatment have a lower tensile strength and elongation compared to the pure PP, but their modulus young are higher, so that the films of PP with addition of pro-oxidant became more fragile and rigid. In addition, the PP film with heating treatment at 90°C cannot be analysed due to it was damaged and destroyed.",Manganese palmitate is a pro-oxidant additive that can easily oxidize and degrade into shorter chains by producing carbonyl groups.,question,1998,149.0
24138,Do Cell Phones Cause Brain Cancer?,The problem with cell phones...or maybe not.,"It's a popular topic … and a baffling question, to boot. Do cellular phones cause brain tumors? 
 
Cell phones (or mobile phones, if you prefer) are ubiquitous. In the United States, current population about 307 million, there are more than 279 million wireless subscribers, say Inskip et al.1 in this issue of Neuro-Oncology; even allowing for users with multiple accounts (say, for work and personal use), that number is staggering. Worldwide, the story is the same: one study reports that there are now 4.6 billion subscribers,2 and another reports that about 50% of the world population (or some 3.3 billion people) were users in 2007.3 Yes, there is some variability in the numbers, but if cell phone use causes or even just elevates the risk for brain tumors … well, you get the picture: we will have plenty of patients for clinical trials. 
 
Do cell phones generate enough RF (radiofrequency) electromagnetic radiation to induce gene mutations and thus increase the risk of brain tumors? The evidence so far is equivocal. Some studies have shown an overall increase in incidence among long-term users, some an increase in only certain histologic types of brain tumors, and some no increase at all or—oddly—a reduction in incidence. Two recent meta-analyses both came down on the side of suggesting that there may be evidence of a link.3,4 So far, no one seems to be able to muster much more conclusiveness than that. 
 
Such analyses have been hindered by methodological inconsistency, potential bias, and reporting and recall inaccuracies—no surprise given the relative youth of the cell phone as a technology in widespread use and the intrinsic difficulties of analyzing epidemiologic events that may take years or even decades to evolve. Similar hindrances impede progress in understanding the risk of late effects from radiotherapy, for instance. And let's not even start on whether anthropogenic global warming is fact or fiction! 
 
We have some hope that the questions about a cell phone–brain tumor link will be answered, eventually. After all, it took years of study for people to accept that lead-based paint could contribute to impaired IQ and that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. What is required are time and evidence. Neuro-Oncology cannot alter the laws of physics and so can have no effect on the former, but we can contribute to the body of knowledge. 
 
In this issue, we do so by publishing the aforementioned article by Inskip et al.,1 who have delved into the records of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to gain more insight. Although this evidence is drawn from just the United States, its insights should be applicable worldwide, as biologic processes know no national borders.",Cell phones generate enough RF (radiofrequency) to induce gene mutations and thus increase the risk of brain tumors.,question,2750,113.0

Research on this disease has been complicated by the fact that the specific features and presentations of ADHD show substantial variability between individuals, and that no single pathophysiological profile of ADHD has been identified (1,2). Although the exact cause of ADHD is still unknown, both genetic and environmental factors are now recognized to play a role in the development of the disease (3, 4, 5). Children who suffer from sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have been reported to experience learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and impaired attention in much the same manner as children with ADHD, suggesting that SDB and some forms of ADHD may share common pathophysiological mechanisms (see Chapter 19). These findings in clinical populations with sleep disorders have led to the hypothesis that exposure to intermittent hypoxia, such as that encountered in SDB, during critical developmental periods is an important environmental contributor to the development of ADHD-like behavioral problems, and may be particularly important in individuals with a genetic predisposition to develop ADHD. In support of this hypothesis, data from animal experiments has shown that exposure to intermittent hypoxia, the primary hallmark of SDB, replicates many of the behavioral features of ADHD and may provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying some nongenetic forms of ADHD-like pathology.",Exposure to intermittent hypoxia during critical developmental periods is an important environmental contributor to ADHD-like behavioral problems.,question,1646,189.0

The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of caffeine on high intensity time trial (TT) cycling performance in well-trained subjects.


SUBJECTS
Six male cyclists with the following physical characteristics (mean +/- SD) age 30.7 +/- 12, height 179.3 +/- 7.5 cm, mass 70.0 +/- 7.5 kg, VO2max 65.0 +/- 6.3 mL.kg-1.min-1 undertook three 1-h TT performances, control (C), placebo (P) and caffeine (CAF), on a Velotron cycle ergometer conducted in a double-blind, random fashion. Subjects rested for 60 min and were then given CAF or P in a dose of 6 mg.kg-1 body mass and then commenced exercise after another 60 min of rest. Before ingestion, 60 min postingestion, and at the end of the TT, finger-prick blood samples were analyzed for lactate.


RESULTS
The cyclists rode significantly further in the CAF trial (28.0 +/- 1.3 km) than they did in the C (26.3 +/- 1.5 km, P < .01) or P (26.4 +/- 1.5 km, P < .02) trials. No differences were seen in heart rate data throughout the TT (P > .05). Blood lactate levels were significantly higher at the end of the trials than either at rest or postingestion (P < .0001), but there were no differences between the three trial groups.

14600,the benefits of adopting sustainable supply chain management,A systematic literature review of quantitative models for sustainable supply chain management.,"Supply chain management is the basis for the execution of operations, being considered as the core of the business function in the 21st century. On the other hand, at present, factors such as the reduction of natural resources, the search for competitive advantages, government laws and global agreements, have generated a greater interest in the sustainable development, which, in order to achieve it, industries need to rethink and plan their supply chain considering a path of sustainability. So sustainable supply chain management emerges as a means to integrate stakeholders' concern for profit and cost reduction with environmental and social requirements, attracting significant interest among managers, researchers and practitioners. The main objective of this study is to provide a synthesis of the key elements of the quantitative model offerings that use sustainability indicators in the design and management of forward supply chains. To achieve this objective, we developed a systematic literature review that includes seventy articles published during the last decade in peer-reviewed journals in English language. In addition a 4 W's analysis (When, Who, What, and Where) is applied and three structural dimensions are defined and grouped by categories: Supply chain management, modeling and sustainability. As part of the results we evidenced a continuous growth in the scientific production of this type of articles, with a predominance of deterministic mathematical programming models with an environmental economic perspective. Finally, we identified research gaps, highlighting the lack of integral inclusion of a life cycle analysis in the design of supply chain networks.","Sustainable supply chain management is a means to integrate stakeholders' concern for profit and cost reduction with environmental and social requirements, attracting significant interest among managers, researchers, and practitioners.",phrase,1693,152.0

The value of understanding individual contribution and the relevant physical factors is of importance when structuring appropriate strength and conditioning training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the relationships between physical performance and game performance, as well as examining the relationships of physical performance and game performance dependent on competition level. This research project was a case study conducted with a team’s game performance measured across a full season. Twelve elite adolescent male ice hockey players (17.92 ± 0.9 years, 185 ± 8.45 cm, 83.17 ± 8.61 kg) participated in the study after giving informed consent. Physical performance was measured using four tests (horizontal jump, single-leg lateral jump, 15-meter sprint, corner S test), while game performance was calculated through the statistical equation Point Shares. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Physical performance did not depict any strong indications of overall game performance. Instead, results illustrated an inverse relationship between plyometric performance and offensive point shares. However, on-ice agility may be a relevant indicator of game performance dependent on competition level for individuals and sub-groups.

5130,effect of year building to house price,Housing markets and demographics,"Fifteen years ago, like today, there were concerns that house prices might collapse. One big difference between then and now, however, is the basis for those concerns. Today, people are worried that a house price bubble (if one exists) might burst, while 15 years ago, people were worried about demographic effects, specifically, the inevitable aging of the baby boomers. ; The earlier concern was sparked by a paper by Mankiw and Weil (1989), in which the authors famously predicted that between 1987 and 2007, real house prices could fall by 3% per year. In fact, real house prices grew by an average of 3-1/2% per year from 1987 to 2004. Of course, the Mankiw-Weil prediction may yet come to pass; or it may have already occurred and simply been masked by the surge in demand over the last seven years that is due to other factors. But the relationship between demographics and house prices remains interesting both because housing constitutes such a large component of the typical household's wealth, and because much remains to be understood about the consequences of the baby boomers liquidating their housing and financial assets. In this Economic Letter, I revisit the economics of the housing market and demographics.","Between 1987 and 2007, real house prices could fall by 3% per year, with real house prices grew by an average of 3-1/2% per year from 1987 to 2004.",phrase,1226,140.0
19787,implementation of critical points in the pharmaceutical industry,An alternative approach to HACCP system implementation,"Abstract The practical implementation of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) and in particular the definition of the critical control points (CCPs) in the food industry is usually a complex structured task. This is particularly the case of small medium enterprise (SMEs), where quality/safety manager ability, knowledge of the production processes and “sensitiveness” is usually the discriminate for the proper identification and prioritization of risks. The same applies for the definition of causes which may lead to food safety hazards. This paper addresses the issues of how quality/safety managers can objectively and automatically implement the first and second principles of hazard analysis in the application of HACCP, which is the identification of risk priorities and of the related CCPs, by means of a structured, quantitative and qualitative methodology. The proposed methodology combines fault tree analysis (FTA) approach, for the analytical decomposition of the relevant steps in the manufacturing process of a food product, and fuzzy logic, for quantitative measures of occurrence likelihood. The practical implications of the methodology are finally tested through a real case application.","Quality/safety managers can objectively implement the first and second principles of hazard analysis in the application of HACCP, which is the identification of risk priorities and related CCPs.",phrase,1221,170.0
7167,does zinc deficiency lead to depression?,Zinc regulation of adult stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the rat dentate gyrus,"Dietary zinc deficiency leads to the development of depression‐ and anxiety‐like behaviors in adult rats. Zinc deficient (ZD) rats displayed anorexia, anhedonia (reduced saccharin:water intake, p<0.001), and decreased exploratory behavior in a light‐dark box test (p<0.05). The antidepressant drug fluoxetine (10mg/kg body wt), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reduced behavioral despair, as measured by the forced swim test, in zinc adequate (ZA), but not ZD rats (p<0.002). Thus, it appears that ZD not only induces depression, but also impairs the efficacy of antidepressant drugs. Because it is known that fluoxetine action is dependent on stem cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus, we hypothesized that low zinc status impairs proliferation in this region of the limbic system. Following 3 wk of zinc‐adequate (ZA, 30 ppm), zinc‐deficient (ZD, 1 ppm), pair‐fed (PF, 30 ppm), or zinc‐supplemented (ZS, 100 ppm) diets, immunohistochemistry was used to quantify the number of Ki67 positive cells as a measure of newly proliferated cells in the dentate. Neurogenesis was determined by the co‐localization of the early neuronal marker, NeuN, with Ki67. Zinc deficiency reduced the number of Ki67 positive cells to 25% of ZA controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, the ZS diet appeared to increase neuronal differentiation. Together, these data suggest that ZD impairs neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in the dentate leading to behaviors consistent with depression in adult rats, and limiting the efficacy of antidepressant drugs.","Zinc deficiency leads to depression and anxietylike behaviors in adult rats, limiting the efficacy of antidepressant drugs.",question,1565,114.0

One area of consternation is the ambiguity of the legal obligations entailed by the deposit contract when it is backed with only fractional reserves. In this article, we apply an existing analysis of the legitimacy and ethicality of banking practices to a wider range of financial transactions, including insurance policies, securities lending, perpetual bonds, and callable loans. Securities lending in particular creates rights violations analogous to those in fractional-reserve banking. Both callable loans and perpetual bonds have clear legal obligations which are not inherently problematic, though we herein clarify what these obligations are. Finally, we apply our ethical framework to demonstrate that insurance products are distinct from banking deposit contracts, and that perceived parallels between the two products underestimate these differences.","Insurance products are distinct from banking deposit contracts, and perceived parallels between the two products underestimate these differences.",question,957,199.0
19460,relationship between lighting and gloss perception,The influence of the illumination geometry and luminance contrast on gloss perception,"Gloss is a main characteristic determining the appearance of objects. Physically, gloss results from directionally selective light scattering at the front surface of a material, with a preference towards the specular reflection direction. However, the sample illuminance and consequently the entire luminance distribution of the illumination scene around the sample could strongly influence gloss perception, especially for high glossy surfaces on which a reflected image becomes perceptible. In this study, the influence of variations in illumination conditions and engendered luminance contrasts on gloss perception has been examined. A psychophysical experiment was conducted in a light booth, especially designed for this purpose.

476,how high is the cancer risk from aspartame?,"Aspartame: A Safety Evaluation Based on Current Use Levels, Regulations, and Toxicological and Epidemiological Studies","Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide used as a synthetic nonnutritive sweetener in over 90 countries worldwide in over 6000 products. The purpose of this investigation was to review the scientific literature on the absorption and metabolism, the current consumption levels worldwide, the toxicology, and recent epidemiological studies on aspartame. Current use levels of aspartame, even by high users in special subgroups, remains well below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority established acceptable daily intake levels of 50 and 40 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Consumption of large doses of aspartame in a single bolus dose will have an effect on some biochemical parameters, including plasma amino acid levels and brain neurotransmitter levels. The rise in plasma levels of phenylalanine and aspartic acid following administration of aspartame at doses less than or equal to 50 mg/kg bw do not exceed those observed postprandially. Acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies with aspartame, and its decomposition products, conducted in mice, rats, hamsters and dogs have consistently found no adverse effect of aspartame with doses up to at least 4000 mg/kg bw/day. Critical review of all carcinogenicity studies conducted on aspartame found no credible evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic. The data from the extensive investigations into the possibility of neurotoxic effects of aspartame, in general, do not support the hypothesis that aspartame in the human diet will affect nervous system function, learning or behavior. Epidemiological studies on aspartame include several case-control studies and one well-conducted prospective epidemiological study with a large cohort, in which the consumption of aspartame was measured. The studies provide no evidence to support an association between aspartame and cancer in any tissue. The weight of existing evidence is that aspartame is safe at current levels of consumption as a nonnutritive sweetener.","Aspartame is safe at current levels of consumption as a nonnutritive sweetener, but current use levels remain well below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority established acceptable daily intake levels of 50 and 40 mg/kg bw/day.",question,2001,163.0

Although selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used to treat both PMS and MDD there is little information on their efficacy in PMS in patients with co-morbid MDD. Objective: To describe the clinical picture of PMS co-morbid with current depressive episode (DE) and evaluate its dynamics under a 6-month course of SSRIs treatment. Materials and methods: We present a longitudinal observational study, conducted in out- and inpatient conditions. Thirty-one women eligible to antidepressant treatment for a current DE in the course of MDD were evaluated for PMS and those of them suffering from both conditions were re-evaluated twice during a 6-month medication intake period. Results: The pre-treatment clinical picture of PMS co-morbid with MDD was dominated by moderately to severely expressed mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, breast tenderness, palpitations, abdominal bloating, and headache. After six months of SSRIs intake the syndrome was characterised by nearly the same symptoms (with the addition of irritability and appetite changes) but mildly expressed. Conclusion: Untreated PMS co-morbid with MDD is characterised by mainly moderately severe psychological and around three times less commonly – somatic symptoms.

Probiotics can positively alter the gut microbiome and nourish the commensal microbial load. Recent studies revealed that the cognitive functions (anxiety and depression) of human beings are meticulously associated with their genetic makeup, food habits, and gut microbiome. The gut microbiome may communicate with the brain through neural and humoral path- ways, while involving several neurotransmitters and signaling molecules. The immune response, especially inflammatory system, plays a critical role in the microbiome and in mental health. Thus, many studies were conducted to explore the beneficial effect of probiotic, single and multistrain, formulations. Fruitful results were observed, but the underlying mechanism of probiotic-mediated improvement of mental health is not fully illustrated, even though some studies explained that the production of neurotransmit- ter-like metabolites by the probiotic strain could be the possible mediator of gut-brain axis.

However, limited research considers the costs of influencer marketing when evaluating these campaigns’ effectiveness, particularly from an engagement elasticity perspective. Moreover, it is unclear whether and how marketers could enhance influencer marketing effectiveness by strategically selecting influencers, targeting their followers, or managing content. This study draws on a communication model to examine how factors related to the sender of a message (influencer), the receiver of the message (influencer's followers), and the message itself (influencer's posts) determine influencer marketing effectiveness. The findings show that influencer originality, follower size, and sponsor salience enhance effectiveness, and posts that announce new product launches diminish it. Several tensions arise when firms select influencers and manage content: Influencer activity, follower–brand fit, and post positivity all exert inverted U-shaped moderating effects on influencer marketing effectiveness, suggesting that firms that adopt a balanced approach along these dimensions can achieve greater effectiveness.

IN 2009, THE National League for Nursing (NLN) conducted a survey to examine the challenges nurse educators faced when choosing and scheduling experiences for students' clinical learning (Ironside & McNelis, 2010). The results indicated the most frequently identified challenge faced by nurse educators was the lack of clinical sites to provide appropriate learning experiences to meet course objectives. Finding clinical sites for specialty nursing courses, such as pediatrics, can be the most difficult of all clinical placements (Kline & Hodges, 2006). This clinical site shortage provides nurse educators the opportunity to redesign classroom and clinical learning activities to meet the learning objectives for acute pediatric disorders. Technology use in nursing education is widely encouraged (Herman, 2011). Nursing education has adapted to include the use of simulation, gaming, virtual reality, and interactive case studies that can teach acute care in a safe learning environment. Additionally, the traditional student of nursing is one that adapts easily to learning activities utilizing technology (Pardue & Morgan, 2008).

3436,what is the impact of the mitochondrial dna in the pathogenecity in onygenales?,Precision modeling of mitochondrial diseases in zebrafish via DdCBE-mediated mtDNA base editing,"Dear Editor, Mitochondrial diseases are a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders that are characterized by dysfunctional mitochondria and often manifest as severe even lethal condition. Mitochondrial diseases can arise from mutations affecting either the nuclear gene or the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whereas pathogenic mutations in mtDNA more commonly cause mitochondrial disease than mutations in nuclear genes do. Up to now, more than 270 pathogenic variants of mtDNA have been reported. Animal models which precisely install these variants are urgently needed both to deepen our understanding for the etiology of mitochondrial diseases and to develop therapeutic strategies. The development of such models, however, has been hindered by the technical challenge of editing mtDNA in a programmable fashion. In recent years, some progresses have been made for mitochondrial genome engineering. Re-engineered RNA-free programmable nucleases such as mtZFN and mitoTALEN function effectively in mitochondria. In a recent work, researchers harnessed a bacterial cytidine deaminase, DddA, to archive precise manipulation of mtDNA sequences. In this system, the domain containing 1264–1427 amino acids of DddA (DddAtox) was split into two inactive halves, which were fused with transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor, resulting in DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs). Besides the study in tissue culture system, installation of disease-associated mtDNA variants in mouse with this DddAtox-TALE strategy has been reported lately. Acclaimed for multiple research advantages and flexibility of manipulation, zebrafish is an attractive animal model for studying human disease. The ability to generate pathogenic mtDNA mutations in zebrafish could accelerate the researches ranging from mitochondrial biology, drug discovery to therapeutic approaches development. In the current study, we set out to utilize the TALEDddAtox fusion deaminases to establish a method for generating models of zebrafish mitochondrial diseases. At first, a variable di-residue (RVD) plasmid library including 192 modules, as well as 4 MTS-DdCBE (mitochondrial localization) and 4 NLS-DdCBE (nuclear localization) backbone plasmids, were constructed (Supplementary Fig. S1a–c). With this library, DdCBE expression plasmids for any desired target site can be obtained within 36 h by one-step Golden Gate assembly (Fig. 1a). To verify the activity of DdCBE, we generated 4 pairs of MTS-DdCBE for the reported ND1 site (Supplementary Fig. S2a), including LeftG1333C (L1333C)+Right-G1333N (R1333N), L1333N+ R1333C, L1397C+R1397N and L1397N+R1397C. First, we examined the subcellular localization of the L1333C+ R1333N pair in HEK293FT cells and found that they could successfully locate to mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Then we transfected cells with each DdCBE pair and found that the ratio of C-to-T conversion increased over time (Supplementary Fig. S2c). To quantitatively evaluate the editing efficiency of DdCBE pairs, deep sequencing was performed. The results showed that different split types and orientations of DddAtox could mediate variable editing efficiencies, with the highest efficiency up to 80.12 ± 3.76% (Supplementary Fig. S2d).

23927,Can coffee improve cognition?,Decaffeinated coffee prevents scopolamine-induced memory impairment in rats,"INTRODUCTION
Several human studies have reported that coffee consumption improves cognitive performance. In the present study, we investigated whether instant decaffeinated coffee also ameliorates cognitive performance and attenuates the detrimental effects of scopolamine on memory.


METHODS
Memory performance was evaluated in Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. Instant decaffeinated coffee (p.o.) at 120 or 240 mg/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats, which is equivalent to approximately three or six cups of coffee, respectively, in a 60 kg human, was administered for two weeks.


RESULTS
Oral gavage administration of instant decaffeinated coffee inhibited scopolamine-induced memory impairment, which was measured by Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. Instant decaffeinated coffee suppressed scopolamine-mediated elevation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and stimulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway (i.e., phosphorylation of IκBα and p65) in the rat hippocampus.

17274,is modern number sense learned or innate?,An emergentist perspective on the origin of number sense,"The finding that human infants and many other animal species are sensitive to numerical quantity has been widely interpreted as evidence for evolved, biologically determined numerical capacities across unrelated species, thereby supporting a ‘nativist’ stance on the origin of number sense. Here, we tackle this issue within the ‘emergentist’ perspective provided by artificial neural network models, and we build on computer simulations to discuss two different approaches to think about the innateness of number sense. The first, illustrated by artificial life simulations, shows that numerical abilities can be supported by domain-specific representations emerging from evolutionary pressure. The second assumes that numerical representations need not be genetically pre-determined but can emerge from the interplay between innate architectural constraints and domain-general learning mechanisms, instantiated in deep learning simulations. We show that deep neural networks endowed with basic visuospatial processing exhibit a remarkable performance in numerosity discrimination before any experience-dependent learning, whereas unsupervised sensory experience with visual sets leads to subsequent improvement of number acuity and reduces the influence of continuous visual cues. The emergent neuronal code for numbers in the model includes both numerosity-sensitive (summation coding) and numerosity-selective response profiles, closely mirroring those found in monkey intraparietal neurons. We conclude that a form of innatism based on architectural and learning biases is a fruitful approach to understanding the origin and development of number sense.

20244,does tramadol improve ocd?,Tramadol: Effects on sexual behavior in male rats are mainly caused by its 5-HT reuptake blocking effects,"&NA; Tramadol is a well‐known and effective analgesic. Recently it was shown that tramadol is also effective in human premature ejaculation. The inhibitory effect of tramadol on the ejaculation latency is probably due to its mechanism of action as a &mgr;‐opioid receptor agonist and noradrenaline/serotonin (5‐HT) reuptake inhibitor. In order to test this speculation, we tested several doses of tramadol in a rat model of male sexual behavior and investigated two types of drugs interfering with the &mgr;‐opioid and the 5‐HT system. First the &mgr;‐opioid receptor agonist properties of tramadol were tested with naloxone, a &mgr;‐opioid receptor antagonist. Second, the effects of WAY100,635, a 5‐HT1A receptor antagonist, were tested on the behavioral effects of tramadol. Finally the effects of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, combined with naloxone or WAY100,635 treatment, were compared to the effects of tramadol combined with these drugs. Results showed that naloxone, at a sexually inactive dose, could only partially antagonize the inhibitory effect of tramadol. Moreover, low and behaviorally inactive doses of WAY100,635, strongly decreased sexual behavior when combined with a behaviorally inactive dose of tramadol. Finally we showed that the effects of paroxetine on sexual behavior resembled the effects of tramadol, indicating that tramadol's inhibitory effects on sexual behavior are primarily and mainly caused by its SSRI properties and that its &mgr;‐opioid receptor agonistic activity only contributes marginally. These findings support the hypothesis that tramadol exerts inhibition of premature ejaculations in men by its 5‐HT reuptake inhibiting properties.

16864,does materialism effect purchase behoaviour?,The mediators of experiential purchases: Determining the impact of psychological needs satisfaction and social comparison,"Once basic needs are satisfied, the relation between income and subjective well-being is small, and materialism leads to diminished well-being. This study attempts to determine: (1) whether experiential purchases, as opposed to materialistic purchases, are likely to increase well-being and (2) whether these increases are likely to be due to increased satisfaction of psychological needs and/or decreased social comparison. Participants indicated that experiential purchases represented money better spent, brought more happiness to themselves, and brought more happiness to others. Path models demonstrated that experiential purchases had an indirect effect on one's well-being through two independent paths: (1) increased relatedness, which then led to increased vitality, and (2) decreased social comparison. Discussion focuses on why vitality and social comparison affect well-being.","Materialistic purchases have an indirect effect on one's well-being through two independent paths: (1) increased relatedness, which led to increased vitality, and (2) decreased social comparison.",question,888,105.0
1518,red meat consumption increase the risk of heart disease?,Red Meat Consumption and the Risk of Stroke: A Dose-Response Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND
Prospective studies of red meat consumption and risk of stroke have provided inconsistent results. We aimed to assess this association by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.


METHODS
Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE through April 1, 2013. Summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by random-effect or fixed-effect models.


RESULTS
Seven prospective cohort studies were included in the analyses, involving 2,079,236 subjects and 21,730 strokes cases. Total red meat consumption was associated with total stroke (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24), cerebral infarction (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.0-1.28), and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.46). A significant association was found between consumption of processed red meat and total stroke (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.27). Consumption of fresh red meat was significantly associated with total stroke (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22) and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.29). However, no evidence suggests that any type of meat was associated with hemorrhagic stroke. Also, no association was found between consumption of processed red meat and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.15, 95% CI .98-1.36) and between consumption of fresh red meat and cerebral infarction (RR = 1.06, 95% CI [.94, 1.20]). A significant risk for total stroke could be observed when the consumption of total red meat was above 50 g/day, processed red meat was just above 0 g/day, and fresh red meat was above 70 g/day.


CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate that high consumption of red meat, especially processed red meat, will increase the risk of stroke.","High consumption of processed red meat, especially processed red meat, will increase the risk of stroke.",phrase,1688,90.0
16803,Does artificial sweetener damage your gut?,Artificial sweetener consumption differentially affects the gut microbiota‐host metabolic interactions,"While there is general agreement on the safety and potential uses of artificial sweeteners, the literature is still lacking a consensus on their long‐term effects on gut microbiota and host‐microbe interactions. To this end, we examined the impact of chronic sweetener consumption on the gut microbiome in lean and diet‐induced obese rats. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (n=40) were randomized into two dietary groups; chow (CH, 12% kcal fat) and high fat (HF, 60% kcal fat). Each dietary group was further divided into groups consuming water or artificially sweetened water (0.4g/100mL EQUAL®, aspartame) for 8wk (n=10/treatment). Animals consumed food and fluids ad libitum. CH and HF animals showed a difference in weight gain and body fat, with the HF rats becoming obese and glucose intolerant (OGTT). Analysis of insulin tolerance (ITT) demonstrated sweetener consumption to reduce insulin sensitivity in both CH and HF. Analysis of the gut microbiome showed marked differences between both diet and fluid treatment. Total Eubacteria was reduced by HF, but maintained with sweetener consumption. Reductions in Lactobacillus were observed in CH sweetener and both HF groups. Bacteroides was reduced in both HF groups but not CH sweetener compared to water controls. In conclusion, results show sweetener to alter host‐microbe interactions in both chow and diet‐induced obese animals.",Artificial sweetener consumption differentially affects the gut microbiotahost metabolic interactions in lean and diet-induced obese rats.,question,1382,144.0

14634,does foreign direct investment affect income inequality?,FDI and income inequality in Africa,"Abstract This paper tests the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on income inequality in a panel of 16 African countries from 1980 to 2013. We controlled for both non-linear effects and heterogeneity by using a Pooled Mean Group estimator. There is robust evidence that the relationship is non-linear and we document a U-shaped effect of FDI on inequality. The results reveal that FDI increases equality of distribution of income in the countries examined. However, this effect diminishes with further increases in FDI. Policy implications emanating from this study suggest that although FDI may be growth enhancing, FDI-induced growth may not necessarily translate into a reduction in inequality. FDI has to be structured in such way that the resulting skill-biased employed is mitigated. To address inequality, policy implications from this study imply that FDI has to target both ends of the labour market.","Foreign direct investment increases equality of distribution of income in the countries examined, but this effect diminishes with further increases in FDI.",question,916,155.0

22068,can strokes be cured?,Prediction model of stroke recurrence based on support vector machine,"Stroke is a disease characterized by high morbidity, high disability and high mortality. In recent years, with the progress of society and the improvement of people’s living standards, the cure and survival rate of stroke is gradually increasing, but at the same time, cases of recurrent stroke have also increased. Among the patients who have experienced recurrent stroke, it often leads to higher mortality and disability than those first-ever stroke patients. Therefore, it is important to improve the risk awareness of patients and medical workers, and to make scientific and accurate predictions on whether patients relapse, which is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of stroke. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the recurrence of stroke patients by analyzing the medical data of stroke patients, and to establish and develop a stroke prediction model based on Support Vector Machine (SVM).

1430,is dl-phenylalanine safe?,Acompanhamento do aleitamento materno no tratamento de crianças com fenilcetonúria,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine, causing toxic effects to the central nervous system. Traditionally, in the treatment of PKU, breastfeeding is replaced by formula milk. This study verified the effects of breastfeeding as a source of phenylalanine on the development of children with PKU. Participants were ten infants with PKU who started treatment with the introduction of formula before 30 days of life, and maintained breastfeeding for at least 30 days after the start of procedures. The procedures were based on estimating breast milk intake, with a safe margin of phenylalanine concentration, calculating stomach volume, and initially offering formula, then breastfeeding on free demand, at every feeding. Breastfeeding duration ranged from one month and five days to 14 months. Blood controls were tested weekly. If the serum level of phenylalanine was >2 mg/dL and 2 mg/dL, the formula was decreased by 25%, indirectly increasing breastfeeding; if it was <6 mg/dL the formula was increased by 50%. The phenylalanine levels were assessed, and the Early Milestone Scale and the Basic Steps of Development were applied. Those who had normative index in all evaluations were considered adequate. Eighty percent of infants were able to keep safe concentrations of phenylalanine and development within normal indices. Continued breastfeeding is viable in the treatment of children with PKU, provided that phenylalanine levels are strictly controlled and the effects of breastfeeding on child development are monitored.","Continued breastfeeding is viable in the treatment of children with PKU, provided that phenylalanine levels are strictly controlled and the effects of breastfeeding on child development are monitored.",question,1565,193.0

Consequently, the higher education system of Taiwan has evolved from an elite system to a universal one. The rapid expansion of higher education is also characterized by salient features such as the increase of higher degrees, an enlarged private sector, and diminishing numbers of junior college institutions and students. This study explores whether these changes at the national level have brought challenges to the labour market. Our findings reveal that intensified competition for employment caused by the increased number of college graduates has incurred extra monetary cost and uncertain wage prospects at the individual level.

22750,why the sky is blue?,Skylight Polarization patterns and Animal Orientation,"1.Although many invertebrate animals orient by means of ultraviolet sky-light polarization patterns, existing measurements of these patterns are inadequate for full analysis of the biologically relevant information available from the sky. To fill this gap we have used a precision scanning polarimeter to measure simultaneously the intensity, degree, and direction of vibration (E-vector orientation) of polarized light at 5° intervals over the sky. The resulting sky maps were constructed for u.v. (350 nm) and visible wavelengths (500 and 650 nm) under a variety of atmospheric conditions. 2.Our measurements confirmed that the patterns of radiance and degree of polarization of skylight are highly variable and hence unreliable as orientation cues; but patterns of E-vector orientation are relatively stable and predictable over most of the sky under all but very hazy or overcast conditions. 3.The observed E-vector patterns correspond more closely to predictions based on first order (Rayleigh) scattering at 650 and 500 nm than at 350 nm. This is true both in terms of absolute accuracy and the proportion of the sky with relatively ‘correct’ information. Yet most insects respond to polarization patterns only at u.v. wavelengths. This apparent paradox can perhaps be resolved by assuming that there is no great selective advantage for any particular wavelength when large areas of blue sky are visible, but that under special and difficult conditions ultraviolet has advantages over longer wavelengths. Measurements under partially cloud-covered sky, for instance, or under extensive vegetation, show that both spuriously polarized and unpolarized light resulting from reflexions present more troublesome interference at longer wavelengths than in the u.v. 4.The accuracy of orientation achieved by dancing honey bees appears to be greater than can readily be accounted for by assuming that they use a strictly geometrical or analytical processing system for their orientation to polarized light.",The accuracy of orientation achieved by dancing honey bees appears to be greater than can readily be accounted for by assuming that they use a strictly geometrical or analytical processing system for their orientation to polarized light.,question,2004,79.0

There is an extensive literature on the role of omega 3 polyunsaturates in ameliorating the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, including both atherosclerotic and thrombotic factors. In addition, there is a limited number of studies which report the results of trials testing the effects of fish oils on other clinical conditions including diabetes, arthritis, migraine and psoriasis.

This chapter presents a perspective in which moral development is a process of constructions involving thought and emotions arising from bidirectional interactions with the environment. Morality is a domain entailing understandings of welfare, justice, and rights. The moral domain is formed along with the distinct domains of understandings of social conventions in social systems and arenas of personal jurisdiction. As part of individuals' reflective thought processes, their decisions often involve weighing and balancing considerations from different domains and opposing practices seen as unfair.

4810,advantages of keto diet over caloric restriction,Caloric restriction augments brain glutamic acid decarboxylase‐65 and ‐67 expression,"The ketogenic diet is a very low‐carbohydrate, high‐fat diet used to treat refractory epilepsy. We hypothesized that this diet may act by increasing expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate‐limiting enzyme in γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis. Thus, we evaluated brain GAD levels in a well‐established, seizure‐suppressing, rodent model of the ketogenic diet. Because the diet is most effective when administered with a modest (∼10%) calorie restriction, we studied three groups of animals: rats fed ad libitum standard rat chow (Ad lib‐Std); calorie‐restricted standard chow (CR‐Std); and an isocaloric, calorie‐restricted ketogenic diet (CR‐Ket). We found that GAD67 mRNA was significantly increased in the inferior and superior colliculi and cerebellar cortex in both CR diet groups compared with control (e.g., by 45% in the superior colliculus and by 71% in the cerebellar cortex; P < .001). GAD65 mRNA was selectively increased in the superior colliculus and temporal cortex in both CR‐Std and CR‐Ket diet groups compared with ad lib controls. The only apparent CR‐Ket‐specific effect was a 30% increase in GAD67 mRNA in the striatum (P = .03). Enhanced GAD immunoreactivity was detected in parallel with the mRNA changes. These data clearly show that calorie restriction increases brain GAD65 and ‐67 expression in several brain regions, independent of ketogenic effects. These observations may explain why caloric restriction improves the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in treating epilepsy and suggest that diet modification might be useful in treatment of a number of brain disorders characterized by impaired GAD or GABA activity. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","Caloric restriction increases brain glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression in several brain regions, independent of ketogenic effects.",phrase,1685,163.0
9865,is climate changed caused by humans?,"Mammoth tracks indicate a declining Late Pleistocene population in southwestern Alberta, Canada","Abstract Much debate has raged over the role that early humans played in this most recent large extinction. Fossil mammoth ( Mammuthus primigenius ) footprints were discovered at the St. Mary Reservoir in southwestern Canada (Wally's Beach DhPg-8). They are located in aeolian sediment dated at 11,300–11,000 years BP. By comparing the size distribution of these tracks with those of modern African elephants ( Loxodonta africana ), the age distribution of this mammoth population was determined. Containing far fewer juveniles than would be expected for an expanding or stable population, these tracks provide the first evidence that a living mammoth population, coexisting with human inhabitants, was in decline. Additionally, the same site provides corroborating evidence of humans hunting megafauna (horse and bovids). This suggests that humans, in addition to climate change, played a role in the end Pleistocene extinctions in North America.","Humans, in addition to climate change, played a role in the end Pleistocene extinctions in North America.",question,947,97.0
1151,do conscientious objection laws harm sexual minority health?,A Matter of Conscience: Examining the Law and Policy of Conscientious Objection in Health Care,"Conscientious objection refers to refusal by a health care provider (HCP) to provide certain treatments, including the standard of care, to a patient based upon the provider’s personal, ethical, or religious beliefs. Federal and state rules regarding conscientious objection have expanded the scope of legal protections that HCPs and institutions can invoke in support of refusal. Opponents of these rules argue that allowing refusal of care deprives patients of care that conforms to professionally established guidelines, contradicts long-standing principles related to informed consent, interferes with the ability of health care facilities to provide safe and efficient care, and leaves the patient without means of redress for injury. Proponents respond that such rules are necessary to preserve the moral integrity of providers, including institutions. Although refusal rules are most often associated with abortion, some HCPs have cited moral concerns regarding contraception, sterilization, prevention/treatment of sexually transmitted infections, transition-related care for transgender individuals, medication-assisted treatment of substance use disorders, the use of artificial reproductive technologies, and patient preferences for end-of-life care. Evidence suggests that the burden of conscientious refusal falls disproportionately on vulnerable populations, and legitimate concern exists that moral disagreement is merely pretext for discrimination. A careful balance must be struck between the defending the conscience rights of HCPs and the civil rights of patients.","Conscientious objection laws deprive patients of care that conforms to professionally established guidelines, contradicts informed consent, interferes with health care facilities' ability to provide safe and efficient care, and leaves the patient without redress for injury.",question,1583,178.0
21063,what does current epidemiology say about mdd depression in canada,"Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. I. Classification, burden and principles of management.","BACKGROUND
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most burdensome illnesses in Canada. The purpose of this introductory section of the 2009 revised CANMAT guidelines is to provide definitions of the depressive disorders (with an emphasis on MDD), summarize Canadian data concerning their epidemiology and describe overarching principles of managing these conditions. This section on ""Classification, Burden and Principles of Management"" is one of 5 guideline articles in the 2009 CANMAT guidelines.


METHODS
The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to the Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support.


RESULTS
Epidemiologic data indicate that MDD afflicts 11% of Canadians at some time in their lives, and approximately 4% during any given year. MDD has a detrimental impact on overall health, role functioning and quality of life. Detection of MDD, accurate diagnosis and provision of evidence-based treatment are challenging tasks for both clinicians and for the health systems in which they work.


LIMITATIONS
Epidemiologic and clinical data cannot be seamlessly linked due to heterogeneity of syndromes within the population.


CONCLUSIONS
In the eight years since the last CANMAT Guidelines for Treatment of Depressive Disorders were published, progress has been made in understanding the epidemiology and treatment of these disorders. Evidence supporting specific therapeutic interventions is summarized and evaluated in subsequent sections.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) afflicts 11% of Canadians at some time in their lives, and approximately 4% during any given year.",question,1748,101.0

South American Aztec Indians referred to them as teonanacatl , meaning “god’s flesh,” and they were used in religious and healing rituals. Spanish missionaries in the 1500s attempted to destroy all records and evidence of the use of these mushrooms. Nevertheless, a 16th century Spanish Franciscan friar and historian mentioned teonanacatl in his extensive writings, intriguing 20th century ethnopharmacologists and leading to a decades-long search for the identity of teonanacatl . Their search ultimately led to a 1957 photo-essay in a popular magazine, describing for the Western world the use of these mushrooms. Specimens were ultimately obtained, and their active principle identified and chemically synthesized. In the past 10–15 years several FDA-approved clinical studies have indicated potential medical value for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating depression, anxiety, and certain addictions.

Here, we move one step forward in this direction and learn such representations by leveraging a task consisting in predicting continuous 2D spatial arrangements of objects given object-relationship-object instances (e.g., “cat under chair”) and a simple neural network model that learns the task from annotated images. We show that the model succeeds in this task and, furthermore, that it is capable of predicting correct spatial arrangements for unseen objects if either CNN features or word embeddings of the objects are provided. The differences between visual and linguistic features are discussed. Next, to evaluate the spatial representations learned in the previous task, we introduce a task and a dataset consisting in a set of crowdsourced human ratings of spatial similarity for object pairs. We find that both CNN (convolutional neural network) features and word embeddings predict human judgments of similarity well and that these vectors can be further specialized in spatial knowledge if we update them when training the model that predicts spatial arrangements of objects.

Soy and soy‐related products have been found to help prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. These products can also have antioxidative effects that alleviate hot flashes during menopause and bone loss. These biological and therapeutic functions are primarily due to the isoflavones derived from soy, whose structure is similar to the structure of 17‐β‐oestradiol. Despite the many health benefits for humans and animals, the application of isoflavones remains controversial because of their anti‐oestrogenic properties. We focused on general information regarding isoflavones, as well as their structure, function, and application. We summarized evidence showing that dietary or supplemental isoflavones exert protective effects on the health of humans and animals. Based on the literature, we conclude that soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe; however, more high‐quality trials are needed to fully substantiate their potential use.","Soy foods and isoflavones may be effective and safe, but more high-quality trials are needed to fully substantiate their potential use.",question,1161,160.0

 Stress and Modify Behavior in Canines and Felines: Implications for Human
 Use","Pets can both relieve and exacerbate human stress; humans can do the same for pets (Friedmann 2011, Young 2020). When companion animals experience chronic psychological stress, they become more prone to socially unacceptable behaviors, poor prognosis, pet euthanasia and worsened owner mental health (Dodman 2018, Pegram 2021). Such stress is also associated with medical symptoms like diarrhea and incontinence, and with conditions like atopic dermatitis (Horwitz 2018). These traits make the companion animal’s stress experience a useful, interdependent model for humans. If pet parents and clinicians have access to convenient, effective screening tools for stress, earlier and more affordable behavioral interventions can be conducted. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes screening interventions for stress-related conditions possible. Clinicians routinely collect data about stress in behavioral histories, but they have had limited ways of measuring it. AI offers new, efficient ways to quantify chronic psychological stress and understand its impact. Our team created Pet Happiness, an AI-enabled software program that analyzes behavioral history to generate psychological diagnoses in cats and dogs. Using online and teleconsulting interviews with pet owners, the platform’s AI, “PetTelligence,” reduces consulting inefficiencies and suggests the most useful behavioral interventions. The software is less expensive and may provide more consistent stress measurement than using invasive, unreliable biomarkers such as serum cortisol. If this stress quantification model is validated through further study, it could create a new standard of care in the treatment of canine and feline medical diseases that have psychological stress components, and could eventually be adapted for human use.","Pets can relieve and exacerbate human stress, and are more prone to socially unacceptable behaviors, poor prognosis, pet euthanasia, and worsened owner mental health.",question,1796,186.0
23725,how does spacecraft guidance differ depending on the mission ?,Mathematical modeling of spacecraft guidance and control system in 3D space orbit transfer mission,"Spacecraft performance in an orbital maneuver relies on guidance and control systems which manage the thrust direction within orbit transfer. In this article, the guidance and control approach for spacecraft having a 3D orbit transfer mission is proposed. To derive the optimal variation of steering angles with initial and terminal constraints on the space orbits, a mathematics polynomial function of the guidance command with unknown coefficients is introduced, one of which is determined to achieve the transfer accuracy requirement between space orbits. Genetic Algorithm is employed in finding optimal variation of guidance command and the optimal initial states within the transfer. The attitude control system is also modeled to evaluate the spacecraft response with respect to generated commands by the guidance system. Gas thrusters are considered as attitude actuators for space mission and linear controller with pulse-width pulse-frequency modulator and unconstrained control allocation is employed for controlling steering angles. Results indicate that the presented approach for guidance and control system fairly satisfies the mission requirement.",The guidance and control approach for spacecraft having a 3D orbit transfer mission satisfies the mission requirement.,question,1163,209.0

16812,what benefits will 6g offer?,Energy Efficient Device to Device Data Transmission Based on Deep Artificial Learning in 6G Networks,"– The rising wireless service constraints and user compactness have to lead the progress of 6G communication in the modern days. The benefit of 6G over the presented technologies is a huge support for mixed applications and mobility maintenance. Device to Device (D2D) data transmission in 6G has great attention since it gives a better data delivery rate (DDR). Recently, several methods were established for D2D data transmission. However, energy consumption was not considered to improve the network throughput. To handle such problems, an artificial intelligence technique called Deep Neural Regressive Tangent Transfer Classifier (DNRTTC) model is introduced in this research for D2D data transmission in a 6G system. The designed method includes several layers to attain energy-efficient D2D data transmission. The primary layer is the input layer and it includes several mobile nodes as input. Nodes are transmitted to the hidden layer one. For each node, energy, received signal strength, and connection speed of each mobile node is calculated. Then the similarity analysis is done in the following layer where each node is analyzed with its threshold value. The result is sent to the output layer where the better resource mobile nodes are identified by using the activation function. This leads to attaining energy-efficient D2D data transmission in 6G. Results illustrate that the DNRTTC outperformed compared to conventional methods with better energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio, throughput.",The benefit of 6G over the presented technologies is a huge support for mixed applications and mobility maintenance.,question,1510,163.0

In theory, trade openness can affect inflation through changes in market competitiveness and productivity. Nonetheless, previous empirical studies often fail to account for productivity effects, and their results may overstate the role of market competition. This study shows that inflation decreases with greater market competitiveness even after controlling for productivity effects. Indeed, when market competition and productivity effects are both accounted for, trade openness becomes insignificant in explaining inflation. The results support that changes in market competitiveness and productivity are the main channels through which trade openness affects inflation.","Trade openness affects inflation through changes in market competitiveness and productivity, but trade openness becomes insignificant in explaining inflation.",question,802,181.0

The aim of the current study was to assess whether patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia and experiencing persistent positive and negative symptoms improve with the addition of cognitive-behavioural therapy to enriched standard treatment.


METHODS
A controlled study was completed with 42 patients randomized to either cognitive-behavioural therapy plus enriched treatment-as-usual (CBT-ETAU) (n = 24) or enriched treatment-as-usual only (ETAU) (n = 18). Enriched treatment-as-usual comprised comprehensive treatment within specialised schizophrenia treatment services. Cognitive-behavioural therapy was conducted on an individual basis for 6 months (20 sessions). Clinical assessments were done at pretreatment, posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up by raters blind to group allocation.


RESULTS
Significant clinical effects were observed for positive, negative and overall symptom severity for patients treated in CBT-ETAU, although there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups at posttreatment. The most pronounced effect of CBT-ETAU in comparison to ETAU in this study was in the reduction of negative symptoms at follow-up.

6138,what are the effects of financial problem on students?,Student Loan Debt and Financial Stress: Implications for Academic Performance,"With the costs of college on the rise across the United States, many postsecondary educators are concerned about the potential effect of financial strain on student outcomes. Scholars have long hypothesized that students who are concerned about finances may demonstrate lower goal commitment, academic engagement, and persistence (Boatman & Long, 2016; Cabrera, Nora, & Castañeda, 1992; Nora, Barlow, & Crisp, 2006). High levels of student loan debt and financial stress have been associated with increases in students’ likelihood of dropping out, stopping out, or reducing their course loads (Dwyer, Hodson, & McCloud, 2013; Joo, Durband, & Grable, 2008; Robb, Moody, & Abdel-Ghany, 2012). Financial concerns have also been linked with extended time to degree (Letkiewicz et al., 2014), which can further escalate the costs of college. The causal mechanisms linking financial concerns to college outcomes are not fully understood. Researchers have suggested that financial strain may reduce students’ motivation to complete college (Cabrera et al., 1992; Nora et al., 2006) or deplete the cognitive resources students have available to allocate to academic concerns (Northern, O’Brien, & Goetz, 2010), yet few studies have specifically examined the associations between financial concerns and academic performance. Furthermore, researchers have not yet distinguished the effects of high levels of financial stress from more moderate levels of financial stress. These questions have significant implications for student affairs practitioners, who are tasked with ensuring that financial concerns do not negatively affect students’ academic success. Trends in student borrowing and financial stress vary between racial and ethnic groups and by gender, pointing to possible inequities in financial support for college. One study shows that Black bachelor’s degree recipients were more likely to have borrowed $30,000 or more in student loans, potentially reflecting lower access to other forms of financial support (Baum & Steele, 2010). Conversely, Latinx and Asian students may be more averse to taking out student loans, even when other sources of financial aid do not cover college costs (Goldrick-Rab & Kelchen, 2015). Some studies have shown that self-reported financial stress is higher among Students of Color, though this may be accounted for by the inadequacy of available financial resources (Archuleta, Dale, & Spann, 2013; Grable & Joo, 2006). Researchers have found that women report higher levels of financial stress than do men (Archuleta et al., 2013; Heckman, Lim, & Montalto, 2014) but that the amount of student debt associated with an increased risk of dropping out is lower for men than for women (Dwyer et al., 2013). Financial concerns include both objective factors, reflecting the actual availability and use of resources, and subjective factors, reflecting students’ perceptions of their financial stability (Nora et al., 2006).

5267,the risk factors for aki in children?,Relationship Between Acute Kidney Injury and Fluid Overload: Are We Any Closer to the Truth?,"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine www.pccmjournal.org 1097 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a recognized risk factor for poor outcomes in critically ill children (1, 2). In most instances AKI does not occur in isolation. The kidneys are endowed with luxury perfusion in relationship to its metabolic needs, and hence other vital organs are more readily insulted in the context of a systemic insult. Thus in the absence of a targeted insult, in most critically ill children, AKI occurs in association with multiple organ failure (3). Moreover, the mechanism of renal dysfunction and the relationship of structural changes to functional changes in critically ill children are unclear as evidenced by the inconsistent microstructural changes ranging from normal to severe glomerular and tubular damage seen on post mortem or renal biopsy studies of patients with AKI (4, 5). These considerations are important because they underline the fact that AKI cannot be considered in isolation but as one of several target organs that may contribute to a poor outcome. It is in this context that the article by Hames et al (6) published in this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine should be evaluated. Hames et al (6) investigated risk factors for mortality in 98 critically ill children with AKI. Patients excluded were the following: children post cardiotomy, those with chronic kidney failure, those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for an indication other than AKI or fluid overload, and those with incomplete documentation. The primary outcome was death before hospital discharge. The retrospective nature of the study precludes any conclusion about causation. However, there are other limitations including selection bias of only studying children receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT), the variable technique of RRT (an almost equal mix of intermittent hemodialysis and CRRT), and the inclusion of patients receiving Extra Corporeal Life Support, as the etiology of AKI in these patients is even more complex (7). The mortality rate is expectedly high in this high risk population (26–47%) but is unlikely to be due to single organ failure in contemporary critical care units. These risk factors simply confirm what has already been identified in other studies (3.8). To advance our understanding and therapies, what is required is categorization of these cases into more useful subtypes or phenotypes against which specific strategies of prevention or treatment might be directed. An explanation of cause of death is important because it is unlikely due only to AKI and fluid overload. Important considerations to shed light on causation are explanations of contribution of causative factors leading to AKI as well as other vital organ insults. Is the fluid overload a contributor to poor outcomes or an indicator of severely insulted tissues (9)? How does earlier initiation of renal replacement prevent AKI? Recent adult studies have attempted to answer the question of timing initiation of CRRT without consensus (10–12). Can a common mechanism for the development of AKI be postulated from the diverse range of underlying conditions (stem cell transplant, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, medical cardiac disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) reported in this study population? How can we differentiate a functional AKI from a structural AKI? How can we identify which patients have structural changes that are reversible? The questions posed need to be answered to fully understand any relationship between AKI, fluid overload, and poor outcomes. Recovery from experimental acute ischemia generated by renal artery clamping suggests a significant degree of resilience from systemic circulatory aberrations (13). However, the microcirculation might be a leading culprit to the functional and possibly structural changes in the kidney as well as multiple organ damage in more severe and prolonged systemic insults. Whether via disturbances in oxygen delivery, endothelial dysfunction, and glycocalyx damage or perhaps amplification of an already dysfunctional inflammatory system, altered microcirculation likely plays a central role (14). Fluid balance alone is unlikely to contribute from a mechanistic perspective. The role of biomarkers remains elusive but holds promise. Kellum et al (15) describes the validation of two novel urinary biomarkers exploring the mechanisms of functional and structural changes in AKI. A recent adult study was able to identify two distinct phenotypes of AKI in adult patients with ARDS and AKI using a battery of endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers (16). Identifying the different phenotypes hold promise for early warnings of functional and structural changes in the kidney, but therapies that we can apply to support renal recovery still eludes us. *See also p. 1069.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a recognized risk factor for poor outcomes in critically ill children (1, 2).",phrase,4890,119.0

We argue that trade can affect domestic productivity through economies-of-scale effects, competition effects, reallocation effects, and spillover effects. We then estimate the net impact of these effects. The results of both panel and time-series regressions of manufacturing data indicate that: (1) a decrease in the import price has a positive competition effect on manufacturing productivity growth after 1–2 years, and this impact is bigger when import penetration is bigger; and (2) exporting activity itself does not seem to promote productivity. Our results suggest that the competition effect and/or the reallocation effect are the most powerful among the four channels. Simulation results indicate that import competition accounted for about 32 percent of labor productivity growth in manufacturing during 1996–2001.","Trade can affect domestic productivity through economies-of-scale effects, competition effects, reallocation effects, and spillover effects.",phrase,909,142.0

Given the lack of research within dentistry as it relates to workplace bullying (WPB), the purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of WPB and predictors of WPB for dental hygienists in clinical practice.


METHODS
Cross-sectional survey research was used with a convenience sample of dental hygienists (n=943) providing patient care to explore WPB. Ninety-three percent of participants resided in the United States, and 6.9% lived internationally. The survey was shared via social media on Facebook and Instagram group pages, specifically dental focused. The validated Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R) was used to measure the exposure WPB using descriptive, correlation, chi-square and Mann-Whitney U.


RESULTS
The completion rate was 81% (n=765). Results showed 21% of participants had experienced WPB now and then, 9.4% several times a week, and 2.9% almost daily. Predictors for WPB included highest degree earned (p=-0.03), US (United States) region of residence (p=0.001), clinical setting (private practice versus dental service organization) (p<0.001), clinical years of experience (p=0.002), and work status (full- or part-time) (p=0.02).

The results showed that although good miscibility of both resins with PBAT matrix was achieved, GR in 10 wt.% showed better interfacial adhesion with the PBAT matrix than UT. The thermal characterization suggested that GR and UT reduce PBAT melting enthalpy and enhance its thermal stability, improving PBAT processability. A 10 wt.% of GR significantly increased the tensile properties of PBAT, while a 15 wt.% of UT maintained PBAT tensile performance. The obtained materials showed higher hydrophobicity than neat PBAT. Thus, GR and UT demonstrated that they are advantageous additives for PBAT–resin compounding for rigid food packaging which are easy to process and adequate for industrial scalability. At the same time, they enhance its mechanical and hydrophobic performance.",Polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) is a biodegradable polymer with good features for packaging applications.,question,1445,205.0
5175,the effect of using educational technology games to teach english vocabulary,A Quantitative Study in Using Digital Games to Enhance the Vocabulary Level of Saudi Male Secondary School Students,"Vocabulary learning is crucial to language acquisition. Although numerous techniques have been proposed for the teaching and learning of vocabulary, the need remains for the research and development of new, effective methods. In this technological era, digital games have proven their efficacy in promoting learners’ vocabulary acquisition. The current study investigates whether the integration of technology-driven digital games is effective in enhancing the vocabulary level by comparing experimental and control groups. The researcher conducted a pretest for the experimental group and a posttest for both groups within a period of five consecutive weeks. The experimental group used 7 Little Words, which is a game for learning vocabulary, whereas the participants in the control group learned vocabulary through traditional methods. The sample comprised 30 Arabic native speakers studying English as a required course in two all-male classes (15 students from each) in the third year of secondary school. Data were analyzed quantitatively. Paired-samples t-tests and independent-samples t-tests were used to compare the mean scores of the two groups. The results indicated that using digital games to learn vocabulary enhanced learners’ overall vocabulary acquisition.",Digital games enhance learners' overall vocabulary acquisition by enhancing vocabulary by comparing experimental and control groups.,phrase,1274,90.0
357,how do musicians incorporate their cultural traditions into cross-cultural music making?,Editorial,"Several of the articles in this issue raise interesting and important questions about the intercultural nature of music, though in rather different ways. These questions arise most directly and at a fairly elaborate theoretical level in the article by Graham Vulliamy and John Shepherd, but there are other possibly unintentional contributions from writers as diverse as Brian Loane, Felix Cross and Kevin Hamel. Music educators find themselves on very difficult ground when attempting to step outside the particular musical culture in which they happen to have been initiated. For most of us this is the older Western classical tradition, though for an increasing number there is now more involvement with music of the pop and rock traditions, with jazz or with other forms of contemporary music. If teachers choose to stay within the limitations of the music they understand they are, perhaps rightly, considered to be' ethnocentric', having little sympathy with the music of other cultures. If, on the other hand, teachers dare, however tentatively, to explore other musics (including the great wealth of the Afro-American traditions) then they become open to the charge that they misunderstand and misinterpret them. How can we respond to music originating in a social context of which we have no first-hand experience? Yet it seems obvious that we can and do respond to the music of other times and places. Indeed, in so responding we might argue that we better understand these cultures: and that to become involved in the music of a society is to gain insights into that society. It is also certain that people will inevitably re-interpret the music of other cultures to fit their own musical expectations. Thus, for example, we have hymns sung on South Pacific islands in quite a different way from that envisaged by missionaries from cities in England; we have Viennese masses in Brazil written by people who had never been to Europe, but who managed in an extraordinary way to adapt the styles to their own particular image of how music should be; we have references to medieval and Tudor traditions in the music of Steeleye Span. Such re-interpretations are the life-force of music as it changes and develops from time to time and place to place. Such a transformation is described in the article by Felix Cross. Here we notice the cross-influences of Africa and America on the music of Jamaica, or, more specifically, on reggae. We are also aware of the powerful influence that reggae has had on popular music in Europe during the last decade or so. In the article by Kevin Hamel attention is drawn to the fertile possi-",People will inevitably re-interpret the music of other cultures to fit their own musical expectations.,question,2632,164.0

This paper develops a generalized additive mixed model that aids managers in predicting how a football player is expected to perform in a new team. It does so by using event-level data from the Spanish and the Colombian football leagues. Using passes as a performance proxy, the model exploits the richness of the data to account for the difficulty of each pass attempt performed by each player over an entire season. The model estimates are then used to determine how a player transferred from the Colombian league should perform in the Spanish league, taking into account that teammates and rivals’ abilities are different in the latter.","Transfers are big business in association football, and managers predict how a football player is expected to perform in a new team.",question,691,134.0
14473,what are the effects of homeless encampment sweeps?,"Impact of a Homeless Encampment Closure on Crime Complaints in the Bronx, New York City, 2017: Implications for Municipal Policy","Purpose: As part of COVID-19 control policy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised local jurisdictions to permit the formation of homeless encampments to prevent community disease spread. This new federal public health guidance is in conflict with existing police policies in many jurisdictions to raze or evict homeless encampments upon discovery. However, no empirical research on homeless encampment policy actions exists. Methods: This study utilized interrupted time series to estimate the impact of the 2017 closure of ""the Hole""-a longstanding encampment of homeless people who use drugs in the Bronx, New York City-on crime complaints. Daily crime complaints originating from public spaces within 1 mile of the encampment were captured during the 30-day periods before and after closure. Results: Closure was associated with no short-term changes in complaints [IRR = 1.01;95% CI (0.81-1.27)], with daily complaints remaining at baseline levels during the post-closure period [IRR 0.99;95% CI (0.98-1.00)]. Discussion: Findings preliminarily suggest that the presence of a homeless encampment may not have been associated with increased levels of crime in the neighborhood where it was located. Future research is necessary to understand the health and social impacts of homeless encampments and inform municipal policymakers.

1713,Does Cholesterol in Food Count?,"Cholesterol: Properties, Processing Effects, and Determination","Cholesterol is a small, yet complex four-ring molecule providing vital biological functions for the eukaryotic cell membrane. Although cholesterol is the sole precursor of many steroid hormones required for the growth, development, and reproduction of mammals, the lethal effects of excess serum cholesterol have been well documented. Primary sources of cholesterol in foods are meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, and seafood. Food processing primarily causes changes in cholesterol content through moisture loss and oxidation. Cholesterol oxidation products, although occurring in minute amounts compared with cholesterol, may potentially pose greater risks to human health because of their toxicity. The determination of cholesterol is simpler than that of cholesterol oxides because cholesterol exists in a much greater concentration and less susceptible to further degradation during analytic procedures. Cholesterol and cholesterol oxides are primarily determined by gas chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with detection means from as simple as flame ionization or ultraviolet absorption to as complicated as electrochemistry or mass spectrometry.","Cholesterol oxidation products, occurring in minute amounts, may potentially pose greater risks to human health due to their toxicity.",question,1173,146.0

Those, who are appointed to be impartial, tend to favor the home team as they systematically award more injury time in close matches when the home team is behind. Referees also tend to favor the home team in decisions to award goals and penalty kicks. The composition of the crowd affects the size and the direction of the bias. The intensity of social pressure as measured by the crowd's proximity to the field determines how strongly referees' decisions are influenced.

We find that both permanent income and wealth are better predictors of life satisfaction than current income and wealth. They matter not only in absolute terms but also in comparative terms. However, their relative impacts differ. The first exerts a comparison effect—the higher the permanent income of the reference group, the lower life satisfaction—the second exerts an information effect—the higher the permanent wealth of the reference group, the higher life satisfaction. We also show that negative transitory shocks to income reduce life satisfaction while transitory shocks to wealth have no effect. Lastly, we analyse the effects of their components and find that not all of them predict life satisfaction: permanent taxes do not matter, while only the value of permanent real estate, financial and business assets do. Finally, we use quantile regression and analyse to what extent our results vary along the well-being distribution, finding the impacts to be larger at lower levels of life satisfaction.","Both permanent income and wealth are better predictors of life satisfaction than current income and wealth, but their relative impacts differ.",question,1078,164.0

At the same time, an intellectual movement known as modernity/coloniality research collective has been critically reflecting about modernity and its often-neglected counterpart, coloniality, to resist universalism and to decolonize knowledge. Engaging with the attempts to procure pluralism in the discourse of international relations, the purpose of this article is to question the different perspectives of non-Western international relations from a decolonial angle to identify intellectual projects that could lead to decolonizing the discipline. In its discussion of how decolonial non-Western IR theory is, the article argues that while some perspectives within the subfield openly reject or simply ignore the concerns raised by decolonial thought, others put forward intellectual projects where decolonial arguments resonate. Hence, rather than characterizing the subfield in general terms, the article distinguishes those perspectives that are attentive to the need of generating a true dialog among knowledges and, by so doing, it contributes to critical scholarship within international relations.",Decolonial non-Western IR theory contributes to critical scholarship within international relations.,question,1334,154.0

It provides us with the capacity to deal with the opportunities and challenges that are part of our complex and fast-changing world. The question as to what facilitates creative cognition—the ability to come up with creative ideas, problem solutions and products—is as old as the human sciences, and various means to enhance creative cognition have been studied. Despite earlier scientific studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of music on cognition, the effect of music listening on creative cognition has remained largely unexplored. The current study experimentally tests whether listening to specific types of music (four classical music excerpts systematically varying on valance and arousal), as compared to a silence control condition, facilitates divergent and convergent creativity. Creativity was higher for participants who listened to ‘happy music’ (i.e., classical music high on arousal and positive mood) while performing the divergent creativity task, than for participants who performed the task in silence. No effect of music was found for convergent creativity. In addition to the scientific contribution, the current findings may have important practical implications.

An effective and sustainable soil protection measure is to reduce the intensity of tillage. On-farm trials were conducted to compare the effect of strip tillage (ST), full-width reduced tillage (RT) and intensive tillage (IT) systems on surface runoff and soil loss in sugar beet crops grown on four typical loess sites in hilly regions of southern Germany in 2014 and 2015. Heavy rainfall (24 mm 20 min −1 ) was simulated in the 4–6 leaf stage of sugar beet with a small portable nozzle rainfall simulator. Observed data were used to establish soil loss ratios for ST as part of the cropping and management factor of RUSLE. Compared to IT, surface runoff was 55% and 92% lower for RT and ST, respectively, caused by increased water infiltration presumably due to (i) higher earthworm activity and (ii) the absence of negative effects of reduced tillage intensity on penetration resistance. Moreover, reducing tillage intensity increased surface residue cover, initial water content and organic carbon content in the topsoil layer. Soil loss was 85% and 98% lower for RT and ST compared to IT, respectively, as a result of (i) decreased runoff rates, (ii) higher stability of aggregates against the impact of raindrops and (iii) reduced velocity of the runoff flow and thereby lower sediment concentrations. Based on residue cover, the soil loss ratio calculated for ST agreed well with values established for other tillage systems. Overall, reducing tillage intensity by strip tillage was proven to offer environmental benefits due to reduced surface runoff and soil loss. In addition, plant-available water likely increases through enhanced infiltration.","Strip tillage is proven to offer environmental benefits due to reduced surface runoff and soil loss, with plant-available water likely increases through enhanced infiltration.",question,1798,202.0

The goal of anesthesia is to avoid hypertension and tachycardia. Nitroglycerin, as a coronary vasodilator, can aggravate the degree of systolic narrowing of the coronary artery. This finding appears to conflict with ordinary management for cardiac ischemia.","Myocardial ischemia, infarction and sudden death can occur some patients with a myocardial bridge, but the clinical course can be worse if pheochromocytoma coexists with a myocardial bridge.",question,764,102.0

However, there are mixed results. For example, a correlation between low vitamin D and mood disorders has been observed [24-26] but other studies have shown no such associations [27,28]. A 2014 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials including 4,923 subjects showed no significant reduction in depressive symptoms following vitamin D supplementation [29]. The authors of this meta-analysis noted that most of the studies focused on individuals with low levels of depression and sufficient vitamin D levels at baseline. They suggest that future RCTs be conducted with individuals with depression and low vitamin D levels. The authors also point out that there was variability in the doses of vitamin D administered. In the experience of the lead author of our paper normalizing abnormally low levels of vitamin D often requires supplementation well above the recommended daily allowances. In the support of this, a small RCT of 36 subjects, treated with 50,000 IU vitamin D per week showed a trend toward greater improvement compared to placebo (P=.06), but also showed improvement on a number of biomarkers of oxidative stress and insulin resistance [30].

10631,relationship between child psychology and technology,Introduction to the special issue: eHealth in pediatric psychology.,"The interaction between psychology and technology has a rich history. Psychologists have always been resourceful in finding ways to utilize technology to enhance the provision of clinical care. However, the proliferation of computers and the Internet has vastly expanded the possibilities. The Internet, in particular, has ushered in the new field of eHealth within psychology. eHealth has been defined as the delivery of health services and information through the Internet and related technologies (Eysenbach, 2001). Given that families with children have a very high rate of computer (93%) and cell phone (95%) ownership (Kennedy, Smith, Wells, & Wellman, 2008), as well as the notable fact that 93% of youth (ages 12–17 years) and 94% of parents of these teens (87% of all parents) are online (Macgill, 2007), this has particular relevance to pediatric psychology. The Internet has become an important source of health care and medical information. Between 75% and 80% of Internet users have searched for health-related information online, making the act of looking for health information one of the most popular uses of the Internet (Fox, 2006, 2008). Parents, in particular, frequently use the Internet to search for information about their child’s condition (Whyte & Hunter, 2008), and are more likely to use the Internet, and to look for health and medical information online, than nonparents (Fox, 2005). In addition, parents whose children suffer from a chronic condition are more likely to search the Internet for health-related information than those who have healthy children or children with acute conditions (Tuffrey & Finlay, 2002).",The Internet has a very high rate of computer and cell phone ownership among families with children and 94% of parents of these teens.,phrase,1648,138.0

12239,How effective is regenerative farming?,Restoring soil quality of woody agroecosystems in Mediterranean drylands through regenerative agriculture,"Abstract Regenerative agriculture (RA) is gaining increasing recognition as a plausible solution to restore degraded agroecosystems. In Mediterranean drylands, RA is at incipient state of development and has been limitedly adopted by farmers, partly due to the lack of empirical evidence on its impacts. To support its large-scale adoption, we carried out a participatory monitoring project in southeast Spain, involving local farmers applying different RA practices in 9 almond farms. To assess the effect of RA, in each farm we selected one field with regenerative management and one nearby field with conventional management based on frequent tillage (CT). We clustered fields under regenerative management based on the RA practices applied by farmers and distinguished 4 types of RA treatments: 1) reduced tillage with green manure (GM), 2) reduced tillage with organic amendments (OA), 3) reduced tillage with green manure and organic amendments (GM&OA), and 4) no tillage with permanent natural covers and organic amendments (NT&OA). We evaluated the impacts of RA compared to CT by comparing physical (bulk density and aggregate stability), chemical (pH, salinity, total N, P, K, available P, and exchangeable cations) and biological (SOC, POC, PON, microbial activity) properties of soil quality and the nutritional status of almond trees (leaf N, P and K). Our results show that GM improved soil physical properties, presenting higher soil aggregate stability. We found that OA improved most soil chemical and biological properties, showing higher contents of SOC, POC, PON, total N, K, P, available P, exchangeable cations and microbial respiration. RA treatments combining ground covers and organic amendments (GM&OA and NT&OA) exhibited greater overall soil quality restoration than individual practices. NT&OA stood out for presenting the highest soil quality improvements. All RA treatments maintained similar crop nutritional status compared to CT. We conclude that RA has strong potential to restore the physical, chemical and biological quality of soils of woody agroecosystems in Mediterranean drylands without compromising their nutritional status, thereby enhancing their resilience to climate change and long term sustainability.","Regenerative agriculture (RA) has strong potential to restore degraded agroecosystems, enhancing resilience to climate change and long term sustainability.",question,2250,184.0

9233,can prayer heal disease?,Prayer and health outcomes in church members.,"CONTEXT
This study adds to the existing research on religion and health by focusing on the specific practice of prayer and its relationship to health outcomes.


OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this survey is to examine the relationship of frequency of prayer to 8 categories of physical and mental health.


DESIGN
The Presbyterian Church, USA, performed data collection as part of an ongoing research program. Members of the Presbyterian Church were randomly selected from the national population and surveyed by mail on their frequency of prayer and their health status, as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short-form 36 Health Survey.


RESULTS
Self-reports of health indicated a high level of functioning overall for all 8 categories of physical and mental health. People who prayed more often scored lower in their physical functioning and their ability to carry out role activities, and higher in their reports of physical pain. However, people who prayed more often also had significantly higher mental health scores than did those who prayed less frequently, despite their physical health problems.

This study supports the relationship of a high frequency of prayer with a more positive mental health. Various explanations of the results are explored.","People who prayed more often scored lower in their physical functioning and their ability to carry out role activities, and higher in their reports of physical pain.",question,1273,129.0
22453,effect of socioeconomic status on meat consumption,"Jerkies, tacos, and burgers: Subjective socioeconomic status and meat preference","In mankind's evolutionary past, those who consumed meat were strong and powerful and thus man saw meat as indicative of social status. This symbolic connection between meat and status persists today. Thus, based upon psychological theories of compensation, individuals low on subjective socioeconomic status (SES) should have a greater preference for meat, as meat may be substitutable for the status that they lack. Three experiments tested this premise. Participants who felt low on subjective SES preferred meat-based foods compared to participants who felt high on it (Experiment 1). The effect is driven by a desire for status (Experiments 2-3) and not by felt hunger or power (Experiments 1-2) and not generalizable to plant foods (Experiment 3). The results suggest a symbolic link between meat and status, which has intriguingly not yet been empirically shown, and we also demonstrate a consequence of the link for food preference. The results may be of use for doctors who advise eating less meat to improve physical health and for environmental advocates who argue that meat consumption exacerbates global warming. We will also discuss the contributions of and further avenues based on our work.",Participants who felt low on subjective socioeconomic status preferred meat-based foods compared to participants who felt high on it (Experiment 1).,phrase,1205,138.0
14487,what is corporate sociopolitical activism?,Corporate Sociopolitical Activism and Firm Value,"Stakeholders have long pressured firms to provide societal benefits in addition to generating shareholder wealth. Such benefits have traditionally come in the form of corporate social responsibility. However, many stakeholders now expect firms to demonstrate their values by expressing public support for or opposition to one side of a partisan sociopolitical issue, a phenomenon the authors call “corporate sociopolitical activism” (CSA). Such activities differ from commonly favored corporate social responsibility and have the potential to both strengthen and sever stakeholder relationships, thus making their impact on firm value uncertain. Using signaling and screening theories, the authors analyze 293 CSA events initiated by 149 firms across 39 industries, and find that, on average, CSA elicits an adverse reaction from investors. Investors evaluate CSA as a signal of a firm’s allocation of resources away from profit-oriented objectives and toward a risky activity with uncertain outcomes. The authors further identify two sets of moderators: (1) CSA’s deviation from key stakeholders’ values and brand image and (2) characteristics of CSA’s resource implementation, which affect investor and customer responses. The findings provide new and important implications for marketing theory and practice.","Corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) elicits an adverse reaction from investors, making their impact on firm value uncertain.",question,1311,154.0

8056,where is the brain part that stai reflects?,Perceptual Gloss Parameters Are Encoded by Population Responses in the Monkey Inferior Temporal Cortex,"There are neurons localized in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkey that selectively respond to specific ranges of gloss characterized by combinations of three physical reflectance parameters: specular reflectance (ρs), diffuse reflectance (ρd), and spread of specular reflection (α; Nishio et al., 2012). In the present study, we examined how the activities of these gloss-selective IT neurons are related to perceived gloss. In an earlier psychophysical study, Ferwerda et al. (2001) identified a perceptually uniform gloss space defined by two axes where the c-axis corresponds to a nonlinear combination of ρs and ρd and the d-axis corresponds to 1 − α. In the present study, we tested the responses of gloss-selective neurons to stimuli in the perceptual gloss space defined by the c- and d-axes. We found that gloss-selective neurons systematically changed their responses in the perceptual gloss space, and the distribution of the tuning directions of the population of gloss-selective neurons is biased toward directions in which perceived gloss increases. We also found that a set of perceptual gloss parameters as well as surface albedo can be well explained by the population activities of gloss-selective neurons, and that these parameters are likely encoded by the gloss-selective neurons in this area of the STS to represent various glosses. These results thus provide evidence that the IT cortex represents perceptual gloss space.","Gloss-selective neurons selectively respond to specific ranges of gloss characterized by combinations of three physical reflectance parameters: specular reflectance, diffuse reflectance, and spread of specular reflection.",question,1512,88.0

18136,does magnesium help with sleep?,Magnesium oxide supplements for the treatment of post-chemotherapy sleep disturbance.,"175Background: While every cancer patient suffers from anxiety and sleep disturbance during cancer treatment, many physicians do not recognize that these problems can continue long after treatment has ended. Many cancer patients feel increased anxiety immediately after treatment ends when they find themselves “on their own,” without the protection of the medical armamentarium. The fear of recurrence, uncertainty about the future, a sense of vulnerability, awareness of mortality, and grief for the loss of a disease-free life all contribute to anxiety and sleep disturbance long term. Magnesium has been used for sleep induction and relaxation for centuries. The primary mechanism by which sleep is enhanced is by muscle relaxation. Magnesium induces muscle relaxation by preventing calcium from binding to troponin, parvalbumin, myosin, and calmodulin, thereby blocking muscle contraction. High levels of free magnesium competitively bind these proteins, and the slow dissociation of bound magnesium provides prolon...","Magnesium oxide supplements help with sleep induction and relaxation, preventing calcium from binding to troponin, parvalbumin, myosin, and calmodulin.",question,1023,114.0

19302,is cold immersion helpful for health,Mechanistic control of the cold-induced augmentation of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α,"Cold water immersion is commonly used to alleviate the stress and damage that ensues following strenuous exercise. Alongside its purported performance and analgesic benefits recent literature highlights the positive impact it may have towards endurance adaptive responses, particularly on key markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. Despite these recent advances showing PGC-1α, the ‘master regulator’ of mitochondrial biogenesis, being augmented in its post-exercise response by cold water immersion, the precise controlling mechanisms remain to be determined. However, it has been suggested that local cooling effects on AMPK and p38 MAPK related signalling and/or increased systemic β-adrenergic stimulation are involved. Study 1 (Chapter 4) examined whether post-exercise cold-water immersion induced augmentation of PGC-1α mRNA is mediated through local or systemic mechanisms. Participants completed acute cycling followed by seated-rest (CON) or single-leg cold-water immersion (CWI; 10 min, 8°C) with muscle biopsies obtained pre-, post- and 3 h post-exercise from a single limb in the CON condition but from both limbs in CWI (thereby providing tissue from a CWI and non-immersed limb, NOT). Muscle temperature decreased following CWI (-5°C), with lesser changes observed in CON and NOT (-3°C; P<0.05). A significant interaction effect was present for AMPK phosphorylation (P=0.031). Exercise (CON) increased gene expression of PGC-1α 3 h post-exercise (~5-fold; P<0.001). Post-exercise CWI augmented PGC-1α expression above CON in immersed (CWI; ~9-fold; P=0.003) and NOT limbs (~12-fold; P=0.001). Plasma Normetanephrine concentration was higher in CWI vs. CON post-immersion (860 vs. 665 pmol·L-1; P=0.034). Data herein reports for the first time that local cooling of the immersed limb evokes transcriptional control of PGC1-α in the non-immersed limb, suggesting increased systemic β-adrenergic activation of AMPK may mediate, in part, post-exercise cold-induction of PGC-1α mRNA. Study 2 (Chapter 5) assessed the impact of combining a post-exercise cooling stimulus with prior low glycogen as both stressors are shown to separately enhance the post-exercise PGC-1α response. A single-leg depletion protocol and bi-lateral muscle biopsies with and without post-exercise CWI were utilised to give the following conditions: High glycogen control (HI CON), Low glycogen control (LO CON), High glycogen CWI (HI CWI) and Low glycogen CWI (LO CWI). HI limbs began the experimental day ~190 mmol·kg-1dry weight (dw) with low limbs at ~85 mmol·kg-1dw glycogen before undergoing the same relative exercise protocol as Chapter 4. PGC-1α mRNA was different between conditions (P = 0.039) with HI glycogen limbs showing greater expression than contralateral LO glycogen limbs (P < 0.05). PGC-1α mRNA increased to a greater extent in CWI HI vs. CON HI (ES 0.67 Large). Data herein supports previous research that shows post-exercise CWI is able to augment PGC-1α above the exercise response alone, however this response was not evident in heavily depleted limbs (~85 mmol·kg-1dw), suggesting a critical threshold may exist for the expected enhancement of PGC-1α to occur when exercise is commenced in a low glycogen state. Chapter 6 sought to examine the contribution of CWI (Chapter 4, Experiment 1) and/or low muscle glycogen (Chapter 5, Experiment 2) in the activation of PGC-1α via either the canonical (Exon 1a) or the alternative promoter (Exon 1b) regions. Data was obtained using muscle biopsy samples collected from the previous chapters (Chapter 4 and 5). Exercise increased the expression of promoter specific PGC-1α, with greater fold changes seen in Exon 1b. Experiment 1 (Chapter 4) showed PGC-1α Exon 1b expression closely matched the pattern of expression seen for total-PGC-1α, with large, systemic cold-induced increases in the non-immersed (NOT, 2344 fold change from Pre, P = 0.010) and immersed (CWI, 1860 fold change from Pre, P = 0.07), compared with the control limb (CON, 579 fold change from Pre). Results from experiment 2 (Chapter 5) saw PGC-1α Exon 1a and 1b gene expression increase post-exercise, with the Exon 1b response showing lower fold-changes at 3h post-exercise compared to those from Experiment 1 (chapter 4), despite the same exercise protocol being utilised (~200 fold increases in experiment 2 vs. ~2000 fold increases in experiment 1). The data suggests that depletion exercise in the days prior to the experimental day may have raised basal RNA levels, which may have therefore contributed to dampened fold-changes seen post-exercise when relativized to pre-exercise values. The lack of a cold augmentation in promoter specific PGC-1α gene expression in experiment 2 suggests this response may be extremely acute, and may not occur when cooling is undertaken on the third day of exercise. This thesis provides a novel insight into the influence of local, systemic and upstream activating mechanisms regulating the post-exercise, post-cooling and exercising in low glycogen states upon PGC-1α. These findings provide mechanistic application for future study designs and practical application in the support for the use of CWI when the intended target is an upregulation of the gene PGC-1α.","Cold water immersion induced augmentation of PGC-1 mRNA is mediated by local or systemic mechanisms, suggesting it may be extremely acute and not occur on the third day of exercise.",question,5231,160.0

Objectives of this study aimed to examine the prevalence of geographical accessibility, types of healthcare services, and the types of health seeking behaviour in 2 northern rural areas of Sabah to assess the geographic accessibility and availability of healthcare services. Materials and Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two rural areas in Sabah—Kudat and Pitas. Data collection was done by using questionnaire and face–to-face interviews. Results: It was found that 48% of the study population sought healthcare and they mainly chose healthcare services from hospitals and health clinics. Conclusion: Half of the population in the areas studied used healthcare in the last year. The choice of using a public hospital or community health clinics was determined by distance from residence.","Sabah's unique geographical location and landscape, such as steep hills and rivers, is one of the challenges that health staff face.",question,1298,174.0
7337,why is homosexuality forbidden in islam?,"The Effects of Islam, Religiosity, and Socialization on Muslim-Canadian Opinions about Same-Sex Marriage","Critics of Islam often frame anti-Islamic positions as a defense of tolerance against intolerance, and of equality against inequality. Islam, for this perspective, poses challenges for the ideological integration of Muslim immigrants in Western societies. This paper examines Canadian Muslims’ opinions about same-sex marriage. The analysis suggests that Canadian Muslims, as a group, do have distinctively negative opinions about same-sex marriage, but that there is substantial and systematic variation in opinions about this issue within the Muslim-Canadian community. Indeed, it is religiosity in general, rather than Islam in particular, that generates negative opinions about gay marriage. Exposure to the Canadian context, and especially postsecondary education, largely undoes the distinctiveness of Canadian Muslims’ opinions about this issue.","Canadian Muslims have distinctively negative opinions about same-sex marriage, but religiosity in general generates negative opinions about gay marriage.",question,852,132.0

8549,the impact of poverty on education,"Schooling, tracking, and inequality","Being poor does not only mean that a child has less money and fewer toys. Poverty is pervasive. It affects diet, nutrition, employment, housing, self-concept, and the entire educational experience. Ironically, Americans have always looked to education as a means of breaking the seemingly endless cycle of poverty. But rather than serve as a great ladder carrying all who climb with concerted effort to social and economic equality, current research suggests some educational structures may actually limit opportunities for certain children. This paper focuses on education in American society and how it may influence inequality . It addresses the question of why students from various social classes differ significantly in academic achievement and it critiques the major theoretical explanations for this difference. Finally, it supports the idea that specific educational structures perpetuate the cycle of poverty by determining educational outcomes and limiting the economic life chances of children. One such educational structure, tracking, or separation by ability, is the focus of this paper. Tracking is a reality in the American school system. Considerable research has revealed class, gender, and race biases with less-advantaged children more often placed in the lower tracks. This paper examines tracking on a national and international basis. It explores various processes within the tracks that limit a child's development and, in turn, have an impact on future economic opportunities. In sum, it examines how tracking may perpetuate the endless cycle of poverty.",Tracking may perpetuate the endless cycle of poverty by determining educational outcomes and limiting the economic life chances of children.,phrase,1580,168.0
20222,outcomes of different chronic illness management styles,The nature of informational continuity of care in general practice.,"BACKGROUND
The availability of patient information to practitioners forms the basis of informational continuity of care. Changes in family practice that now encourage multiphysician clinics have meant that informational continuity of care has become crucial because it is likely that a patient will not continuously see the same doctor. Therefore a review of the nature of informational continuity is useful.


AIM
To answer the question 'How is informational continuity developed in general practice?'.


DESIGN OF STUDY
A rigorous systematic review of relevant electronic databases.


METHOD
Databases were searched for articles answering the research question. Articles focused on family medicine and informational continuity of care were included. Data from reviewed articles were independently extracted and reviewed by two researchers. Conceptual and evidence-based articles were included.


RESULTS
Initially, 193 articles were obtained from all five bibliographic databases; 57 were retained following title and abstract review. Of these, 34 articles were included in the final systematic review. Results show that informational continuity of care is developed using paper/electronic records and remembered information collectively, through a series of doctor-patient consultations over time. Obstacles to its development are practitioners not recording patient information and patients not disclosing important details.


CONCLUSION
These findings have implications for newer styles of primary care that may have a negative impact in the successful management of chronic illnesses in particular.",Informational continuity of care is developed using paper/electronic records and remembered information collectively through a series of doctor-patient consultations over time.,phrase,1604,144.0
9069,effects of communication of parents to student academic achievement,Quality Matters More Than Quantity: Parent–Child Communication and Adolescents’ Academic Performance,"This study examined the effects of parent–child communication, including the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these communications, on young American adolescents’ academic performance by using an Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten dataset. We considered children’s self-concept a mediator in examining the effects. Structural equation modeling was used for evaluating the model. The results revealed that the quality of parent–child communication was positively associated with these children’s academic performance, and this association can be mediated by the adolescents’ self-concept. However, the quantity of parent–child communication did not show a direct or an indirect association with the adolescents’ academic achievements. These findings suggest that efforts to improve the quality of parent–child communication and to strengthen the connection between high-quality communications and adolescents’ self-concept may benefit young adolescents’ academic development.","Quality of parent-child communication positively associated with young American adolescents' academic performance, but quantity of parent-child communication does not show a direct or indirect association with adolescents' academic achievements.",phrase,994,121.0
10797,does better nurse knowledge prevent incidents?,Why Should We Investigate Knowledge Risks Incidents? - Lessons from Four Cases,"In a knowledge-based economy, knowledge has become the most important source for competitive advantage. Thus, organizations spend more attention on the protection of knowledge and also research on knowledge protection has gained increasing attention in the past years. However, knowledge protection research mainly focuses on the design of preventive measures and little is published about real incidents or reactive measures. Learning from failure and from incidents is important to improve current practice. This paper reflects on four cases of real knowledge risk incidents. We discuss ways to prevent or delay knowledge spillovers and the importance of knowing the threats in order to prevent them. In addition to preventive measures, we highlight that companies need to have reactive measures in place. Finally, based on our insights we discuss why analyzing incidents in addition to identified threats is important for practice as well as academia.",Knowledge protection research mainly focuses on the design of preventive measures and little is published about real incidents or reactive measures.,question,954,122.0

7736,social media in reducing inequalities in accessing stem education,Integrating Social Media Platforms in Construction Education to Increase Student Engagement,"This study evaluates the integration of Social Media (SM) as an informal pedagogical tool to support STEM, by fostering engagement and increasing interactional competency and collaborative skills. Construction engineering education has been plagued with low engagement levels partially due to its timeworn pedagogical means and ineffective use of technology. SM platforms are convenient, and effective informal educational means that encourage engagement and interactions between peers. Nowadays, construction programs are shifting to online educational forms and this research is geared to understand the interactions between student bodies within different instructional forms. This study focuses on assessing the impact of SM related activities on students’ engagement and professional skills by integration it within Construction Management (CM) courses. The novel contribution of this research is to study the benefit of integrating SM not only for increasing student engagement but also effective communication between online and face to face CM students as well as their soft skill development. This research initiative presents paired t-test and box plots with line plots from pre and post-course surveys of 75 students. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges and lessons learned along with recommendations for transferring this pedagogy to other institutions.","Using social media platforms can increase student engagement and interactions between peers, fostering engagement and interactional competency and collaborative skills.",phrase,1375,140.0
10795,differences between vigorous and moderate physical activity in hippocampus,Relative Vigorous-Intensity Physical Activity Predicts Brain Microstructural Changes in Older Adults,"Abstract Physical activity especially at moderate-to-vigorous intensity may preserve brain structure in old age. However, current findings are cross-sectional and rely on absolute intensity. This study aimed to examine whether relative or absolute vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) predicts brain microstructural changes. We analyzed 260 initially cognitively normal and well-functioning participants(age=70.5yrs) who had VPA data via ActiHeart and longitudinal brain microstructure by DTI(follow-up=3.7yrs). Associations of VPA with microstructural changes were examined using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for demographics. Each SD higher relative VPA defined by heart rate reserve (i.e. 21 min/day) was significantly associated with less decline in memory-related microstructural integrity, including mean diffusivity of entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus and fractional anisotropy of uncinate fasciculus and cingulum-hippocampal part, and not executive/motor-related microstructure. Absolute VPA was not associated with microstructural markers. Among well-functioning older adults, participating in VPA defined by heart rate reserve may predict less brain microstructural decline in memory-related areas.",Relative vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) predicts brain microstructural changes in older adults.,phrase,1234,192.0
13183,does spanking positively impact childhood development?,Examining the Longitudinal Effect of Spanking on Young Latinx Child Behavior Problems,"Spanking is a divisive discipline practice in the USA and is considered an inappropriate and harmful discipline tactic by some scholars and practitioners. However, increased diversity in the USA has contributed to varying cultural beliefs regarding discipline, which in turn influences child development. While prior literature has examined correlates of spanking, few studies have examined its impact on Latinx children over time. We examined the use of spanking by Mexican-American (n = 185) and Dominican-American mothers (n = 141) across three time points. The main objective was to investigate whether maternal spanking predicted externalizing problems in young Latinx youth overtime. Families were recruited from public urban schools. Data were collected when children were 4-, 5- and 6-years old. A three-wave cross-lagged multi-group path analysis examined the potential reciprocal relationships between maternal spanking and child externalizing behaviors. According to cross-sectional linear regression models, spanking was concurrently associated with behavior problems at all three time points. However, the results of the cross-lagged multi-group path analyses showed that spanking did not predict subsequent behavior problems, nor did behavior problems predict subsequent spanking. The impact of spanking on child behavior may not be long-lasting in all Latinx families. Spanking and youth externalizing problems are concurrently and positively related; however, maternal use of spanking as a means of discipline did not result in negative and long term effects on child externalizing problems. Implications for practice with Latinx families are explored.","Spanking does not predict subsequent behavior problems, nor behavior problems predict subsequent spanking.",question,1668,181.0
2176,do tanning beds increase the risk of cancer?,Nationwide Analysis on Intentional Indoor and Outdoor Tanning: Prevalence and Correlates,"Outdoor and indoor tanning are considered as risk factors for the development of skin cancer. The aims of this nationwide representative study were to quantify both behaviors in a sample with a wide age range, to identify those showing both behaviors and to explore and compare determinants of both behaviors. We used data from the fifth wave (2019) of the National Cancer Aid Monitoring (NCAM). We surveyed the representative sample including 4000 individuals, aged 16–65 years, living in Germany. Data were collected through telephone interviews. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used logistic regression analyses to identify determinants. The one-year-prevalence of tanning bed use was 7.5%, while 31.9% tanned (very) often intentionally outdoors in at least one situation (weekdays, holidays, and weekends). A total of 3.2% reported both risk behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that tanning bed use is associated with employment, an increased number of naevi, and lack of risk awareness. Intentional outdoor tanning was associated with male sex, younger age, past tobacco use, and low risk awareness of UV radiation. Our findings suggest that only a minority of subjects showed both risk behaviors. This implies that individuals seem to perform either one behavior or the other. In addition, the associated determinants differed between both behaviors, implying that specific preventive measures tailored to address to each tanning behavior are needed.","Intentional outdoor tanning is associated with male sex, younger age, past tobacco use, and low risk awareness of UV radiation.",question,1470,142.0

14823,are there effective ways to teach burnout prevention strategies to student nurses?,Burning out physical and emotional fatigue: Evaluating the effects of a programme aimed at reducing burnout among mental health nurses.,"Burnout is a common problem among mental health nurses. High levels of burnout result in job dissatisfaction, rapid turnover of staff, physical and psychological discomfort, and a reduction in the quality of patient care. While there is an abundance of research relating to burnout per se, research regarding the impact of burnout prevention programmes is lacking. This study aimed to measure the effects of a burnout prevention programme on mental health nurses working in Saudi Arabia (SA). A quasi-experimental design was used to test the effectiveness of a two-day burnout prevention workshop. The sample consisted of an intervention group (n = 154) and a control group (n = 142). Data collected using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) measured the effects of the workshop at 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals after completion of the programme. Data were analysed using the latest version of SPSS. Means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages were used to describe the sample and levels of burnout. A t-test, ANOVA, multiple linear regression, and chi-squared were used to measure the effect of the workshop before and at the three time points after exposure. Findings indicate the programme was effective with a significant reduction being reported 1 month after the intervention. However, although not returning to baseline scores, burnout scores had increased at 6 months. In conclusion, while the overall efficacy of the burnout reduction programme is evident, mental health nurses would benefit from having opportunity to use some of the strategies on a regular basis.","Burnout prevention programs are effective with a significant reduction being reported 1 month after the intervention, but burnout scores have increased at 6 months.",question,1587,144.0
6187,does the sun influence in the morphology in leaves?,SHOOT MORPHOLOGY AND LEAF ANATOMY IN RELATION TO PHOTOSYNTHESIS,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses shoot morphology and leaf anatomy in relation to photosynthesis. The youngest leaves of a non-shaded plant usually grow in full sunlight. Some weeks later, the same leaves, now totally expanded and mature, may be shaded to a certain extent by the newly developed younger leaves. This would mean that the light intensity available for photosynthesis could be reduced to less than 10% of full sunlight and, therefore, cause very low net leaf photosynthesis. Therefore, plants may show a distinct leaf arrangement along the stem, which guarantees optimal use of the irradiated light and makes full sunlight available for the largest amount of leaf area. In a growing canopy, these differences in available light are even more striking. The other microclimatic factors show comparable gradients because of the height, density, and geometry of the canopy. Some plants have leaves that adapt well to these changes in the microclimate, whereas others lack this ability.",The youngest leaves of a non-shaded plant usually grow in full sunlight and cause very low net leaf photosynthesis.,question,1003,166.0
12395,do home crowds impact referee bias?,The 12th man?: refereeing bias in English and German soccer,"Summary.  The paper investigates potential bias in awards of player disciplinary sanctions, in the form of cautions (yellow cards) and dismissals (red cards) by referees in the English Premier League and the German Bundesliga. Previous studies of behaviour of soccer referees have not adequately incorporated within‐game information. Descriptive statistics from our samples clearly show that home teams receive fewer yellow and red cards than away teams. These differences may be wrongly interpreted as evidence of bias where the modeller has failed to include within‐game events such as goals scored and recent cards issued. What appears as referee favouritism may actually be excessive and illegal aggressive behaviour by players in teams that are behind in score. We deal with these issues by using a minute‐by‐minute bivariate probit analysis of yellow and red cards issued in games over six seasons in the two leagues. The significance of a variable to denote the difference in score at the time of sanction suggests that foul play that is induced by a losing position is an important influence on the award of yellow and red cards. Controlling for various pre‐game and within‐game variables, we find evidence that is indicative of home team favouritism induced by crowd pressure: in Germany home teams with running tracks in their stadia attract more yellow and red cards than teams playing in stadia with less distance between the crowd and the pitch. Separating the competing teams in matches by favourite and underdog status, as perceived by the betting market, yields further evidence, this time for both leagues, that the source of home teams receiving fewer cards is not just that they are disproportionately often the favoured team and disproportionately ahead in score. Thus there is evidence that is consistent with pure referee bias in relative treatments of home and away teams.",Home teams with running tracks in their stadia attract more yellow and red cards than teams playing in stadia with less distance between crowd and pitch.,question,1895,172.0
