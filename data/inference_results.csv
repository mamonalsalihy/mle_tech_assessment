68,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Reconsidering the Length of Program Accreditation,"While the accreditation of higher education institutions and their programs is voluntary in the United States, students' opportunities are hindered substantially if they attend or earn degrees from nonaccredited programs. For example, federal financial aid is available only to those students enrolled in institutions that have been accredited by an agency recognized by the US Department of Education. In the health professions, graduation from an accredited program is generally a prerequisite for sitting for state board examinations required for licensure as a practitioner. 
 
Accreditation is an important external certification that a program provides an educational experience that is consistent with producing graduates prepared to enter the workforce with the expected knowledge and abilities of entry-level practitioners. Recognizing that practice environments vary substantially, an accreditation agency must ensure that the educational programs it accredits are based on current and emerging standards of practice. Accrediting agencies must, however, strike a balance between ensuring minimal competencies of a program's graduates and allowing sufficient programmatic flexibility to support educational experimentation and innovation. 
 
Reaccreditation of educational programs can be a healthy process that provides an opportunity for programs to assess carefully and strategically their progress, opportunities, and challenges. It is also a time- and resource-intensive process; programs commonly devote 12 to 18 months to the development of a self-study and programmatic assessment in light of Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) standards. During this period, widespread engagement in the self-study by faculty members, students, and staff members is necessary. The time and resources devoted to this process often delay the implementation of other important initiatives; thus, the frequency of reaccreditation itself can slow or minimize the ability of a program to implement educational advances. There is a need for a healthy tension between a frequency of reaccreditation that ensures that the quality of programs does not decline and a frequency that does not affect programmatic advancement adversely. 
 
As deans of pharmacy programs at institutions affiliated with the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC, encompassing the Big Ten institutions and the University of Chicago), the authors collectively represent some of the longest established pharmacy programs in the nation, each with a program history dating between 120 and 150 years. Each of our programs has achieved continuous accreditation since the inception of accreditation of pharmacy programs and has a long history of leadership in educational innovation and advances in the profession of pharmacy. In our annual meetings as a group of deans, we have devoted significant time to discussing the accreditation process for doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) programs. Each of us has experienced the forestalling of important initiatives within our colleges/schools during a period of self-study for reaccreditation. Our shared experiences have convinced us that it is time to reconsider the period for which PharmD programs are accredited. 
 
It is informative to compare the accreditation cycles for PharmD programs with those for other health professions. Table ​Table11 provides a comparison of the maximum length of accreditation for compliant programs for 10 different health professions, all but 2 of which (nurses and physician assistants) require a doctorate-level first professional degree. As shown by this data, ACPE provides the shortest maximum accreditation period of any agency accrediting a health professions program.

Comparison of Maximum Accreditation Length for Compliant Programs (n = 10) 
 
 
 
Are there rational reasons for a shorter accreditation period for PharmD programs compared to other professions? One reasonably could not argue that the complexity of practice in pharmacy exceeds that of other professions, such as medicine and optometry. It would also be indefensible to assert that the pace of change within pharmacy exceeds that of other health professions. In short, we see no reasonable justification for the period of accreditation for established PharmD programs being shorter than that of any other health professions program. 
 
We suggest that the current ACPE policy of awarding well-established programs the same maximal period of accreditation awarded to new programs be modified. Programs with a long history of continuous accreditation are granted the same accreditation length as programs that have gone through only 1 accreditation cycle. We recommend implementation of a tiered system in which programs with a significant history of successful accreditation be granted longer periods between reaccreditation. 
 
What are the risks associated with lengthening the period of accreditation for well-established PharmD programs? The obvious risk is that a program could become non-compliant with accreditation standards between review periods. No evidence exists, however, that shows programmatic compliance is impacted by length of time between review periods. Other health professional programs are managed acceptably with longer periods of time between accreditation visits. In addition, the ACPE's notification requirement in the event of a substantive change in the program or its associated resources provides a process for the council to trigger an earlier programmatic review if concerns about continued compliance with the standards arise as a result of meaningful changes. Recognizing the resources (time, energy, and dollars) required to conduct a self-study and reaccreditation site visit, the benefits for institutions of an extended period of accreditation should be obvious. In addition, it would reduce the burden on ACPE, which has been recognizably stretched with the substantial growth of new programs. An extension of the accreditation length for established programs would allow the council to focus more carefully on at-risk or noncompliant programs. 
 
All programs operate in an increasingly resource-constrained environment. This includes reduced budgets and increased demands on faculty time and energy. Balancing the competing demands on human and fiscal capital is imperative to sustain forward momentum within the profession. The time has come to reassess the time span between reaccreditation as a component of this balancing process. The authors advocate for an extension in the period of maximal accreditation for well-established pharmacy programs (perhaps defined as 3 or more continuous full-accreditation cycles). We believe that such an extension, perhaps combined with an approval process for specific proposed mid-cycle innovations in a program, will allow programs to redirect the resources required for routine reaccreditation into educational innovations, and thus accelerate the pace of change in pharmacy education.",question,7026,165,"Accreditation programs can become non-compliant with accreditation standards between review periods, with no evidence that programmatic compliance is affected by length of time between review periods."

5972,how can accreditation programs be improved?,A configurable assessment information system,"There has been a shift in accreditation away from an input-based approach to an outcome-based approach. In order to be accredited, programs and/or institutions no longer have to meet a long checklist of requirements concerning faculty, curriculum, facilities and so on. Instead, programs or institutions must demonstrate that they have formulated a set of attributes that they want graduates to possess at the time of graduation, and that they have a process in place to assess the extent to which they are successful in enabling graduates to achieve these attributes and to use the results of this assessment for program improvement.Many programs and institutions experienced difficulties in setting up an adequate assessment and continuous improvement process. This paper describes a configurable assessment information system that helps institutions and programs set up an assessment process and record the results of this process.",question,934,153,A configurable assessment information system helps institutions and programs set up an assessment process and record the results of this process.
7094,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Is Accreditation an Opportunity for Positive Change or a Mirage,"Accreditation was originally conceived and applied as an assessment tool for the quality of university programs. However, its emphasis shifted to program objectives and learning outcomes from the original prescriptive focus on measurable inputs. Accreditation normally confirms that the institution/department offering a program has established suitable processes and resources to ensure that the required quality and standards are achieved. Through the years, it has become the fundamental quality assurance mechanism for engineering education (Prados et al. 2005; Sarin 2000; Woollacott 2009). Accreditation is an important step in the life of any professional program, especially for international benchmarking. In the case of engineering programs, accreditation by any signatory of the Washington Accord guarantees international recognition, a feature sought after by many colleges of engineering, especially those in developing countries. Accreditation confirms that graduates have attained a recognized academic standing and that they possess the professional competence to practice engineering. In a majority of developed countries, graduation from an accredited program is the primary step toward professional registration; however, in most developing countries, graduation from any engineering program confers sufficient license to practice engineering. In these countries, graduation from an internationally accredited program provides additional recognition and acceptance. The international recognition of an engineering program has become important in recent years and is likely to be promoted by the increasing mobility of engineering graduates. It is particularly important for graduates in developing countries, who aspire either to work in more developed countries or in multinational companies. Graduation from an accredited program assures possible employers of the quality of education of their entry-level professionals. Because employability of graduates is one of the primary indicators of success and ranking of engineering programs, the competition for talented students has inevitably created a strong tendency, almost a necessity, for engineering programs to be internationally accredited. The accreditation requirements of different accreditation bodies may differ in form and detail, but all expect a considerable amount of documentation as the basis for evaluation. The preparation of the documents can be extremely challenging for first-time program presenters; preparation for each revalidation of the accreditation is also a time consuming activity. This paper advocates that, although the accreditation process is very demanding, it provides a great opportunity for a comprehensive review of an academic program. Ideally, the accreditation process should not only improve the program itself, but should also promote the development of the faculty that delivers the program. However, neither of these two objectives is usually achieved in developing countries. The following argument is based on the authors’ extensive experiences in the management and delivery of engineering programs in different institutions and on their involvement in the preparation of accreditation documents. Unfortunately, the accreditation of a program is not, in itself, a guarantee that the spirit intended by accreditation bodies is captured and implemented in the program.",question,3386,158,"Accreditation is an important step in the life of any professional program, especially for international benchmarking."
8691,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Multiple Assessments and Continuous Improvement of Engineering Technology Programs,"A program thrives only when there is an effort to continuous improvement. An educational institution has to excel its programs to produce better graduates every year and also to excel over the graduates from other institutions. In the process of accreditation, the ABET stresses on eight criteria of engineering and technology programs. Criterion 3 is the Multiple Assessment and Evaluation of the program outcomes. Assessments are the valuable feedback to improve the program itself. Thus while the faculty, by instinct, are always focused to continuously improve their programs, the ABET accreditation process acts as an additional impetus to continuously boost up the program outcomes. By tradition, semester-wise homework, tests, projects, etc. comprise the major components of assessment of student performance. However, this single assessment is very internal to the institution which leads to the students to graduate after a stipulated period of stay at the educational institution. Assessment of a program should go beyond the institutional boundary spatially and in time dimension several years after graduation. Opinion surveys from student internship supervisors, employers, graduate advisors and the same from the graduates themselves about their career advancements are some of the valuable feedback measures from which an institution can be immensely benefited to improve programs. Thus the assessment and improvement are the two major players of a dynamic system loop. This paper discusses some of theses measures to assess a program. The design of some assessment tools is analyzed for their effective use in the process of continuous improvement of programs.",question,1676,206,The ABET accreditation process acts as an additional impetus to continuously boost up the program outcomes.

9948,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Accreditation—Some Background and Observations,"The fields of health, education, and welfare have always shown an active interest in the quality of their programs. Experience in each has shown that one of the most effective methods for improving services has been the establishment of systems of accreditation. Accreditation has been defined as the ""recognition accorded to an institution that meets the standards or criteria established by a competent agency or association. Its general purpose is to promote and inspire high quality of services.':* Accreditation is primarily a means for assuring competence in performance for a hospital, a high school, a university, a social agency, etc. It is an assurance to the public that the accredited agency or institution is well organized, well administered, well staffed and well equipped, and it affords a protection to the public against substandard services. A lengthy account could be written of accreditation as a method of social control. However, it is a well-known fact that groups, institutional representatives, and professional persons with mutual interests find it helpful to discuss common problems. Out of this mutuality of interest and the necessity of detemilning who should become members of these groups certain criteria or standards are developed. As this process evolves it may become structured and formalized into a system of accreditation. Some of the common elements found in such systems are:",question,1416,146,"Accreditation is an assurance to the public that the accredited agency or institution is well organized, well administered, well staffed, and well equipped, and affords a protection against substandard services."
12349,how can accreditation programs be improved?,Assessment techniques for curricular improvement: pre-conference workshop,"Professional and regional accreditation bodies increasingly require programs to maintain a three-part assess/evaluate/improve process. This three-part process must be clearly documented, regularly used, and should be inclusive of all faculty. Adhering to this process should enable a program to determine the extent to which students are achieving stated educational objectives and outcomes. In recent years program assessment has become more rigorous; it is no longer sufficient to collect data and evaluate outcomes once every accreditation cycle. Instead, assessment is now viewed as an ongoing activity that will serve to effect change and should lead to continuous improvement of the curriculum. Program evaluation should also include other key constituents such as alumni, students, and employers. Outcomes-based assessment presents a new set of challenges for departments to grapple with. It is sometimes difficult to identify the types of data to collect, and once collected, how to use the data to evaluate individual courses and the overall program. Moreover, it is challenging to interpret the data to identify specific strengths and weaknesses within the program. 
 
The workshop will begin with an overview of the current state of outcomes-based assessment, and will continue with an explanation of the terminology currently in use. A survey of effective data collection techniques will be presented, including direct and indirect assessment techniques. The presenters own assessment process will be presented and critiqued, and participants will have an opportunity to apply similar techniques for their own assessment and accreditation requirements. The goal of the workshop is to help participants understand how to collect, interpret, and use assessment data for the accreditation process to improve the quality of their courses and the overall degree program. Participants may bring samples of their own course syllabi and program objectives to make the workshop more relevant to their own needs.",question,2014,200,"The workshop will help participants understand how to collect, interpret, and use assessment data for accreditation programs to improve the quality of their courses and the overall degree program."
